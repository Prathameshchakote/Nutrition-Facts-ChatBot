Stick your hand out, thumbs up, feel for the knobby bone  at the top of your wrist. Then, if you slide your hand down  across the front of your wrist, you’ll feel these like  strands of spaghetti— those are the tendons in your wrist. If you lightly feel between the  knobby bone and that first tendon, you should feel your pulse. Got it? Okay, now we’re going  to feel what happens to our pulse when we take a deep breath. We’re going to try it twice. Try to feel what happens to  your pulse when you inhale, and when you exhale. All right, here we go— slow inhale… slow exhale. One more time… What happened when you  breathed in and breathed out? You should have felt your pulse  speed up when you breathe in and slow down when you breathe out -- that’s called heart rate variability, and it’s a very good thing. That’s a measure of the control  our nerves have over our heart. This is the survival curve for  people after a heart attack. With good heart rate variability, 9 out of 10 people are  still alive four years later. But with bad heart rate variability,  in that time period, half drop dead from sudden cardiac death. Is there anything we can do to improve our neurological  control over our heart? A landmark article this year in the  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that there was  only one type of food that could significantly improve  our heart rate variability. Is it citrus fruits, omega-3s, or dark green leafy vegetables? Let’s look at the graph. Here’s the level at which  statistical significance is reached. Let’s see which one makes it. Eating just a half serving  of greens every day significantly improved  neuronal heart control— which may be why studies in the past have suggested a quarter  cup of greens a day could cut our risk of having  a heart attack by 67%! So control your heart— by any greens necessary.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Replay of Dr. Greger's live Q&A on Thursday, August 24.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n\n0:42 Will you update your yoga research?\n\n1:52 What can I do to limit my exposure to radiation from CT and PetScans that I have to do?\n\n4:12 My HDL is too low.

my treadmill instead of every month and answer any questions you may have for those of you unfamiliar with my work every year I read through every issue of every English language nutrition journal in the world so busy folks like you don't have to I think about the most interesting most groundbreaking most practical findings to new videos and articles that upload nearly every day on my non-profit site nutritionfacts.org everything on the website is free there are no ads no corporate sponsorship strictly non-commercial not selling anything just put it up as a public service as a labor of love as a tribute to my grandmother whose own life was saved with evidence-based nutrition all right let's get to your questions I'll just go down the list here first question is from kawar uh yoga webinar um uh I talked about the evidence um based uh presumably on a meta-analysis that covered up into 2020 what about any of the latest um uh so right now on nutritionfacts.org there is a yoga series a six part video series um I probably you know what I do is I go through Topics by alphabet um and so uh I'm almost at the end of the alphabet with with yoga um and then I start again so you'll see videos on apples and videos on you know as we go through so yoga is going to be a while but uh we'll uh when it gets its turn I'll check to see if there's anything juicy um uh there may be a lot of new science but if it basically shows what we've already seen doesn't cover any new diseases came to the same inclusions as before I'll probably skip it um same thing with apples if there's no new good apple stuff that's you know stick with what we know um uh but if there's anything really juicy um I will do more about it since uh it uh people seem to be interested all right next question uh it's from Tasha saying hello what can I do to limit my exposure to radiation oh uh from CT pet scans uh which have to monitor your condition told to take melatonin what does the sign say I do have some uh videos on what to do to cut down on the risk from ionizing radiation of course the primary one is to reduce your exposure in the first place I don't know if they can uh uh if they can stagger them out anymore that may or may not be possible um but if I remember from the video so if you just type in ionizing radiation or probably just radiation and nutritionfacts.org those videos will come up if I remember correctly I think greens um dark green leaf and vegetables presumably maybe only cruciferous I'm not sure I remember it's the only reason I remember is because uh it's one of the reasons I eat kale chips uh when I travel because when you're up in the air that high you're exposed to more cosmic rays and so you actually get quite a really I mean you don't get anywhere near a CT scan dose but uh uh you do actually get a a large relative amount dose of radiation when you uh trap when you fly um for prolonged periods and so I remember thinking oh my kale chips are perfect for this um and so if I remember correctly there's like an X Vivo study where they basically take people's blood um before and after eating greens or took uh or randomized people to eat greens or not and then exposed their um uh white blood cells so they then they took blood from them uh before and after grains and uh exposed them to uh a whopping dose radiation at the people but the blood cells and could show less DNA damage in those who had been eating grains and again I don't remember it's all grains are just cruciferous grains but that suggests that it can either boost DNA repair enzymes or maybe just to make the DNA more robust in the first place um or some kind of DNA protection mechanism but anyway um and it wasn't just greens or other food so check it out nutrition facts or pop right up sorry I don't remember but um I have to clear out space in my brain for all the new stuff coming down and just put everything up in videos and books and move on to the next thing okay next up Johnny says uh ldl2 low um I'm into ACL too low excuse me LDL 54. no you are not okay oh I'm so glad you asked that I kind of misconception um uh no you are um uh in an excellent position with an LDL at 54. um that's really what we are concerned about we used to think that uh HDL was a causal um uh uh kind of inverse respect meaning that we thought having high ACL actually protects you um from heart disease having high HDL is associated um with uh lower rates of heart disease um but the question is is it a causal risk factor or not so I actually did a video this is one of my kind of coconut oil videos if you just type in HDL it'll pop up but basically it was like um just like uh having I think I use the example I use having tennis shoes in a house is correlated with um uh you know with with exercise or having ashtrays in the house having lots of tennis shoes associated with longer life um having lots of ashtrays in the house associated with shorter live and uh but it's not that the ashtrays are hurting you it's just the ashtrays um are are pointing to a pointing to the real cause effector which in that case uh maybe tobacco use and similarly exercise is really what's helping him um and so just got some things correlated with something doesn't mean it causes something um and so that's why we have for example mendelian randomization studies where you know just from a kind of genetic random Lottery some of us are born with genes that give us lifelong elevated levels of HDL or low levels of HDL or high levels of LDL at low levels of LDL and so like regardless of what we eat regardless of whatever we just have the kind of a kind of lower levels if we were eating those same Foods or living that same lifestyle with different genes and so since that kind of genealog and it's kind of random at Birth depending on which egg cell and which sperm cell kind of got together it's kind of like a randomized controlled trial where people are like randomized have Heil deal or loyaldale at Birth kind of lifelong levels and the question is wait a second do they live longer or shorter lives so when it comes to LDL absolutely um you are just have lifelong LDL you dramatically increase risk of dying prematurely of heart disease um in fact uh um you actually have three times more benefit um having lower LDL through um through genetic Means versus Statin means or or medication means just because it's lower for longer we want to have low LDL as long as possible I'm not just starting drugs later in life though that certainly can be helpful if your levels are too high anyway so that's one of the reasons we know LDL causes um uh heart disease so okay what about people born with high HDL if it is indeed cause and effect then people should have less heart disease and turns out they don't um and so uh hos uh kind of a marker of heart health but not cause and effect so raising HCL and so no wonder the trials where they had drugs that raise ACL actually people were in one particular drug people dying more than those who didn't wear on the drug um so across the board all drug all uh drug trials to raise ACL have flopped and now we know why oh well because having pushing HDL higher doesn't actually make things better but pushing LDL lower definitely does again based on these studies there's lots of other kind of studies that we can look at but anyway so we used to worry about the low HCL um uh and like what can we do to raise it like exercise and other things um but uh it turns out that what we care about primarily LDL you can argue that APO B uh there's kind of our uh which is kind of the protein component of LDL and the LDL and IDL but um uh uh LDL is cheaper and probably better recognized although it's very that's in a common lipid panel that's what we care about is what your LDL is doing and your LDL is fantastic congratulations okay Jeff says watch my sold intake um could slightly elevated blood pressure because my stress and Mild anxiety we're taking Gaba and magnesium supplements currently taking magnesium malate um um probably the most important thing is you are not watching your salt intake enough um when people think about oh I don't need a lot of salt they're thinking about the salt that they may add in the kitchen or the dining room but in here in the U.S and it's different around the world but here in the U.S 70 75 somewhere around there of all sodium that people eat has nothing to do with the salt shaker um it has to do with processed foods um and so and when by say processed using like bread bread is leading source of sodium they had a lot of sodium to bread um and uh I think chicken is actually the number one um contributor of sodium intake between like ages 30 and 50 if I remember correctly and you're saying like wait a second like salted chicken no just regular chicken because they actually injected with salt water so it uh retains more water weight because it's sold by the pound so they make more money that way but of course all that salt and phosphate additives no good for us so uh you may think you're doing good on sodium but if you're eating processed foods you're probably not so I would make sure that you get your sodium under 1500 milligrams a day which is the American Heart Association recommendation so I would start there before worrying about other things you can do and before going to supplements I would start eating Foods um that can have been shown to lower your blood pressure I mean if you really want magnesium I want to your dark green leafy vegetables instead um and uh so hibiscus tea um can lower blood pressure a few strong cups in the morning uh better than works better than um uh leading blood pressure drug uh ground flax seeds can lower blood pressure bunch of other stuff uh so just type in blood pressure and nutrition facts that we're going to bring up those foods but again why don't we treat the cause first lower the sodium intake and then see how you're doing um and if necessary add healthy foods to the""), Document(metadata={'description': 'Every month I go live from my treadmill to answer your questions here on YouTube and on Facebook.

Michael Greger live from my treadmill here to answer any and all questions you may have I did a facebook live earlier today and doing YouTube now will do this every month for those who come from

this day let me start at the top and I will go through the questions and hopefully get to yours Paulo a so many health concerns associated with drinking water from plastic bottles I guess there are if you look at there are both microbiological concerns as well as chemical concerns so for example from polycarbonate plastic if you search on nutrition of Exxon org for the word for the letters BPA my you will see my videos about some of these plastics chemicals also on phthalates start spelled with a P P th ala tes my check out those or just type in plastics or plastic into nutrition facts that are a little search bar all my videos will come up um and you can enjoy lance ass how do I prevent water intoxication if I don't salt my foods um if um so hyponatremia is you can actually wash out the electrolytes in your system if you um exercise intensely sweat a lot and or just drinking pure water the concern was that wait a second don't have to add salt to my food as if for millions of years of evolution we had salt shakers sitting there um no need to add salt food um but we should but if you are excessively exercising you need to replete your electrolytes that's the whole kind of gatorade thing you can do it a lot healthier than just drinking sugar water by eating actual food like fruit um and so we should get all our sodium from natural sources not from salsa come not from processed foods you do not have to take a bag of potato chips on your bike rides ah seabird asks I am requesting an option to see Spanish subtitles absolutely in fact we have Spanish subtitles on hundreds of videos people don't realize that if you do a search for videos on nutrition of X or um there's language options you can say I just want to see the ones with Polish subtitles or Russian subtitles or you know the Italian subtitles amen Spanish is actually our most common one we've got hundreds of videos already translated we have a whole team of translation volunteers you actually can be one of those if you'd like to help out we're actually going to convert the entire site into Spanish so not just the subtitles for all the videos but like all the wording on the site so it would be like a little flag you know you go to some websites and it's like you can choose your language um well it's going to be same thing nutrition facts outdoor where you can see in English when you see the entire site in Spanish um and then we're going to move to other languages to broaden the number of people that can have access to this life-changing life-saving information but right now you can access those Spanish subtitles by just doing a search on nutrition facts at work and then clicking the spanish-language buttons all right Laura asked coumadin I've been diagnosed ah with a thrombus a clot warfare every day to maintain a 9r they're vegetarians does guarantee bristled without anticoagulants absolutely not you need anti if you have excessively clotting blood for whatever reason or if you have a heart valve or any kind of internal hardware that could cause your blood to clot although there is there are there's basically what's called salicylic acid which is kind of the active ingredient in aspirin found in plant foods not just in willow bark or as originally harvested from UM and so people eating plant-based diets particularly the spicy plant-based that's just a lot of salicylates in spices like cumin ma you will have blood levels of aspirin on which rival that of people actually taking a baby aspirin a small dose aspirin pill every day even though you're not on aspirin you have the same aspirin doses of your body that may actually been be beneficial in terms of reducing not only heart disease risk a stroke risk certain types of stroke risk as well as cancer risk and I've got a bunch of videos coming up on aspirin and cancer but that's not your blood would not be thin enough to prevent clots if you have some excessive clotting disorder and so if your physician wants you on coumadin then you need to to remain on coumadin as long and just make sure that you they titrate the greens consumption you dark green leafy vegetable consumption the mountain community does basically cumin is a vitamin k poison and so on if you eat a lot of vitamin K you need up your dose to keep them in line alright okay Lance okay um Lance is just making some comments that's good okay I'm gonna keep going down um um I don't know how to pronounce a Jo a with a little thing on it Oh I'm sorry I said he has an exam with 289 people on grams per milliliter of b12 as at a healthy level ma you assuming those the units I'm familiar with um yes that would be fine but you still would want to take the question is should continue to take vitamin b12 of course you should a 2500 microns once a week of cyanic of elements probably all you or anyone should need I mean you say well wait a second more fine levels are fine well they won't be fine for long if you don't get a regular reliable source of vitamin b12 um Sarah read an article from a nutrigenomics company saying that your genes determine whether or not animal or plant base to make 3s are good for you all mega 3s are originally plant-based and are then created by animals such as yourselves when you eat them there may be polymorphisms but which means kind of gene variations in mod Delta 60 saturates enzymes the elongation enzymes but and so one may want to take a preformed long-chain omega-3 fatty acid supplement I've got a bunch of videos new videos about that so check it out a vitamin Lindsay says what do I think about intermittent fasting I've got a bunch of videos on intermittent fasting coming up I keep saying that but I do and it's actually a really complex topic um and but I will be talking about all the variations of intermittent fast and water-only fasting the timing duration meals all sorts of good stuff it's all coming out um it's not that I'm trying to keep anything from you I just haven't read all the science yet there's tremendous load hundreds of new articles um and so I want to make sure I have a sense of where they're going just doing kind of a light reading but I wanted to a deep dive before I before I synthesize all the available science alright Michael good name s if you take a DHA EPA supplement how much ala should get every day as it's still important to keep in to make a six to make a three ratio 4 to 1 um so um if you're already getting prima so the reason one wants to keep their ratio relatively low makes 16 mega threes is to kind of facilitate your body's elongation stretching omega-3s found in flax seeds and walnuts not into the long-chain versions um but also G still need to do that if you're taking um you know and and you need to get a source of of of ala like flex seeds or walnuts or hemp nuts or chia seeds if you're already taking that and my answer is yes to both but not for the reason one might think so I mean what's the recommendation to about make six ratio it stay away from junky vegetables like Cornell safflower oil sunflower oil concealed oil so you'd still want to do that regardless for all sorts of reasons and why so do you not have to take flax seeds now if you're getting a preformed source of of DHA will make you three something only reason we eat a super healthy foods like black seeds and walnuts they have other health problem in compounds for example flax seeds have these anti-cancer lignin compounds which you know you would be missing out on so it's still stick with my daily doesn't recommend actually get a tablespoon of ground flax seeds every day for the other health benefits priscila talked about BPA at the beginning ah ma soeur know are there plant foods that reverse postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and small fiber neuropathy um I do not know of any um but if you do a PubMed search so if you go PubMed gov govt um that's the database National Library of Medicine or just medical library in the world and you type in whatever grow that you're interested in and the word diet or foods or such and Stace come up um I'd be have it look at them send them my way I will dig them up and if there's something interesting useful for others I will make a video about it and share with others alright Steve what foods would I recommend for a toddler to have on a daily basis Oh like a daily dozen toddler version that's a good idea I should come up with that um until I do though I would encourage you to check out wonderful sources like anything Brenda Davis is written or read mangles has written they both done wonderful books and chapters on feeding healthy diets to infants and small children um Cristina named assessing research on diet macular degeneration very certain there is I just haven't looked at it yet I haven't got to my latest I folder um studies I could actually look at it now but it would take some time but if there is I realize that's an issue that a lot of people deal with and we'll definitely do any videos on any new exciting developments in that area David asks what foods increased stamina and energy I need more than a caffeine jolt um well um the question is I mean you should

page_content=""lots of sodium and so we want to reduce our 70 min take under 1,500 milligrams a day that's really difficult to do if we had any salt I'm already processed foods and so I encourage people to stay away from any salty flavorings although look if you're eating all whole plant foods you know you can throw in some olives and still stay under that limit um but there's not much wiggle room biron Murphy asks Oh is responding to a question from maple flavor uh maple flavor would I consider doom or kitchen videos that's very kind of you to ask ah David they were very successful in terms of people seem to like them got lots of views um they're just such a pain they just take a lot of prep time um as anyone who's done cooking videos knows and so they're I have a whole list of all sorts of other cool ones I'd love to do yeah but it's just a matter of finding a time right now I'm in book mode working on the new manuscript but once that's done I'm going to do more webinars maybe I'll slip in some more cooking videos I'm glad you like them Marie Kessler asks pesticides from other sources oh you know rain onto our on a farm what do you do then what do you do is you choose organic that's yeah and reduce your pesticides I also have a DIY food and vegetable wash recipe on my facts org you can just type pesticide wash or fruit and vegetable wash and talk about ways you can reduce pesticides regardless whether you're buying conventional organic um and of course I emphasize in homeland I end in videos on the site that the the risk from pesticides is overwhelmed by the benefits of fruits and vegetables even eating lean most pesticide Laden fruits and vegetables we're talking Chilean imported grapes and bell peppers and spinach and strawberries it is still the benefits far outweigh the risk but you say what why accept any risk at all choose organic fantastic but we should never let concern about pesticides prevent us from stuffing her face full with as many fruits and vegetables as possible Rose Saxena as how much sodium oh there we go under 1500 milligrams I mentioned that before maple flavor says I think you're right about sucralose and then describes how her stools are without using it thank you for that byron Murphy asks Sicily consumes less protein you only need something amount and there is a protein almost every food oh maybe I think Byron is responding to somebody else raw sexiness is cereal a red light food ah depends what's earlier talking on most cereals are crap oh my god do you I mean they're just packed with sugar even like the so called healthy ones there's very few that actually don't have added sugar at itself but there are a few so for example Uncle Sam's I think only has two ingredients which is like rolled wheat and flax seeds oh and I think they have a berry one too acid free drug free strawberries but if you wanna but finding a cereal that actually complies with the five to one fiber rule um if you don't know what the five to one fiber rule is check out the video on that um it's almost impossible Uncle Sam's does it but very few others do um but if you if you're like oh but I really like granola or something make your own you can make your own and and not put your health in the in the hands of corporations that may not have your family's interests at heart maple flavor ass does the massive protein dump from being a plant-based source like eat protein powder without the fiber cause raised igf-1 certainly soy protein does so I believe Lydia talking about igf-1 insulin-like growth factor-1 a cancer growing and growth hormone which is your levels are boosted by animal protein consumption but also enough soy protein consumption but whether or not P protein has the amino acid profile that would raise igf-1 levels I have not looked into but there's no reason for anyone to take protein powders um you can get protein it's like saying well you get carbohydrate powder table sugar or fat powder which is basically oil right why get isolated sources of any of these when you can eat your nutrients in whole plant food all right um all right Oh light dark a snake poop question oh yeah the question is particularly cinnamon toast crunch yes that is a terrible choice but I should I should walk that back right it's always is compared to what is cinnamon toast crunch better than sausage and and eggs yes is it better than opening all not even close all right food isn't go to bed as so much as it is better or worse food is a zero-sum game everything you put in your mouth is a lost opportunity but something even healthier mouth Shushan we should always try to notch things up right Rose rose is sniffing this beautiful spring weather we're having here in DC okay oh I wish I'd get her up on the treadmill okay oh I bet I can turn the camera you want to see you want to see Rose when I had a rose hold on where's rose is that the wrong set no oh yeah Rose rose oh you can't that's not gonna work all right never mind okay never mind she'll bark at least you'll hear her yeah that didn't work okay um where are we here bjk asked when you eat raw broccoli in Mersin ace transforms glucoraphanin into Superman does any clue graph ernst ain't actin is so ba bla bla with the many benefits compared to just so for a fan um yes some stays intact but their benefits I think most of the benefits are from the that which is converted so I would just do all those tricks to convert that was a high level question I'm all for higher level questions if you don't know what I'm talking about you should go to my video second strategy something something something broccoli on nutrition facts that alright ah maple flavor as optimum protein to take for muscle growth 2.7 grams per pound of lean body weight it's actually well I don't know about that um I think she he or she is answering someone else's question point eight grams per kilogram body weight is what our what is our daily Reference intake for protein comes out to be about 50 grams a day a little more from and little less for women okay be JK is okay to eat to drink green tea right after brushing your teeth might it mess with the wind mineralization no it would actually help with remineralization because green tea is a natural source of fluoride okay um looks like Byron is responding to somebody and then GRC VGC is back asking are there natural multi vitamins worth taking there are no multivitamins worth taking as far as I'm concerned um ah unless science comes up says that they're helpful which on so far is sorely lacking although I have not done a video on it and while so maybe there's new research I will get to it my that is in I don't know if that's under V or M I've just started that my new surge through the alphabet so I just have a lot of videos coming up over the next week's on acne and berries and beans and but if you're our favorite food is zucchini you're gonna be waiting a while alright bro sexy Nass should we not eat plant-based foods high with contamination I assume they're talking about pesticide contamination like you cover lettuce grapes and mushrooms cucumbers are among the least nutrient dense foods same with lettuce but green light whole plant foods very low and clora density we should not stay away from any whole plant foods we should eat them up though they're always healthier choices so healthier choice than cucumber and lettuce would be a darker green so so particularly when lettuce is contaminated like romaine lettuce is newly Cola how about arugula on your salad or baby spinach somewhere darker is better alright okay there's a lot of responding to questions light dark zero zero says mushroom no and that's not a question Oh Rebecca asked what do I feel about immunotherapy for allergies last time I checked it's very controversial I don't know what the latest is sorry I can't help with that a lot of answers answers Oh what AIDS sleep best and deals of anxiety are we talking about stress management in my I haven't got to that section yet but most uh in terms of sleep its I do have some videos about melatonin we just found naturally a number of plant foods like strawberries and Tour cherries if I remember correctly but most of healthy sleeping is really sleep hygiene want a dark you want it cool and quiet and there's a bunch of things you if you type in sleep hygiene Google get a lot of good tips this certainly are foods that may help oh but what was the one food what's the pistachios something there's one that's just off the charts in terms of melatonin i the videos are coming up have videos on how to help with jetlag and light therapy and melatonin therapy but you do not want to take melatonin supplements that's something I learned oh and it's a really kind of scary reason why but melatonin foods and get the benefits without the risk in this one food that's just crazy off the chart I think specialist I'd have to check and you can check by checking out the video which should be coming up eventually maybe Wow ok Turtles Rodriguez si like I eat like dr. Michael Greger and my blood pressure still freakin elevated heart rate I'm 80 beats per minute it's too high can someone help me on the one my body's so stupid when everyone is thriving so in so if you are eating a hopeful pump each day and still have elevated blood pressure so my patients have been the situation typically they're actually eating - what sodium they when they say the really hopeful pump ace often they say well I don't eat meat dairy eggs or very frequently but they still may be eating packaged junk food some butch has left so you wouldn't even know lots of stuff has salt in it I'm so cut their salt down it still doesn't make it and you're really arguing whole plant foods diet center a whole plant foods and there are some foods that can draw people of pressure lower I talked about ground flaxseeds I talked about hibiscus tea and herbal tea you can take the drops blood pressure's down so just check out the chapter um how not to die""), Document(metadata={'description': 'Every month I go live from my treadmill to answer your questions here on YouTube and on Facebook.

did do that video it was considered homeless okay oh wow will says wow this is live this is indeed live I am coming to you live from my treadmill in the Washington DC area okay man you will um ask do marathon athletes live longer huh it's a fantastic question I do not know the answer to that obba find out let me know that's neat ah Marjorie says hello hello Dibya ass how do I convince loved ones that dairies and healthy when doctors recommend it as a part of a healthy diet um well I mean if you're willing to you can ask you doctor uh you know to provide you evidence that there aren't healthier way that it's really the healthiest way to get those nutrients I'm so I mean certainly there's calcium in dairy just like there's protein in pork and iron and beef but you know food is a package deal right as much as burg King says have it your way you can't be like yeah I gotta get a burger hold the statue in fact cholesterol no it all comes together um so by getting your calcium from low ox late dark green leafy vegetables for example then the baggage you get is not baggage is the bonus right you get the fiber in the folate and all this other wonderful things found the Greens missing from the dairy you know every time so so basically since soon as a package deal we should get our nutrients in the package that's healthiest so now you can get boxes of Froot Loops says now with calcium in it I mean that's dude that's you know I mean that there's this the food industry loves this nutrient centrism the sense that you know we just need the individual nutrients it's all about nutrients rather than food they love that cuz anything take absolute junk multicolored marshmallows spray it with some multivitamins and then claim it's healthy when we're not dying from deficiency diseases like very very employer and of course your corns curve a we're dying from these excess diseases like excess sugar salt saturated fat cholesterol and that's of course what they're trying to sell you after sprinkling some vitamins on it boy did I get off-topic what was the question Oh dairy huh so I'm yes you can get calcium and dairy but there are healthier sources of calcium I encourage you do that senior counsel we're not the butterfat without the cholesterol um and with all these other wonderful added bonus ingredients so that's what I would recommend right so food isn't my you know bad nor good but better or worse and there's certainly better sources then Dairy Milk is for babies all right Cleveland Clinic states that eggs are healthy to consume and again it's well compared to what I'm compared to breakfast sausage absolutely I agree whoa compared to Oh will not even colos right and so look food is a lost art but every time food has an opportunity cost everything we only have about what two thousand calories in the calorie bank every day so every time we put something in our mouths it's a lost opportunity to put something even healthier in our mouth um and so it's lots healthier things to put in our mouth then eggs sharra asks what'd I ever do a serious oh and Paulo cystic ovaries yes I've got videos on PCOS check it out ty PCOS and didn't do cheat but I said organelle pop right up I think I have a few more coming out in the queue um I'm a Casey Cantore event page yes are the live questions being posted no they're right here in the chat box I call it an event page just because in youtube when you sign up to do a live thing it calls it an event but no this is where you do you ask your questions Casey type away Mike asks any good tips for type one diabetics you started eating hope plant-based Oh what's his name mango man guy my fellow type one diabetic eating whole food plant-based he does a series of diabetes workshops um and he I'm sure will be happy to talk to you about that oh what's his name of the the mango man that's mango man very quickly there he is oh oh okay I don't feel so bad mango man nutrition and fitness that's not just his nose who his name is Cyrus his name is Cyrus what's his last name Cyrus Khambatta so if you go to mango man nutrition Icom uh you can you can learn about his stuff okay um where are we okay um Charlie L what are the best foods for weight loss that's that's a great question I just started my new book how not to diet managed doing March will be out December 2019 um and so I'm working on that all right as we speak but even before I'm doing all the new research for the book um presumably things that are high in fiber water high nutrient density low and caloric density be a good place to start and so that's one of the reasons why whole food plant-based diets appear to be so useful in Oran people to eat all they want but lose weight just because plant foods tend to be so chloric ly dilute that you can eat till you're full and without overdoing calories alright Simon Says thoughts on anything in particular JAF says due to dried fruits raised triglyceride dried fruits in the context of excess calories can just as anything can raise triglycerides but just dried foods on their own should not affect your triglyceride levels yeah but same thing with like soda you got a sip a soda it's not gonna raise triglycerides either but you have a liter of soda in your triglycerides will shoot out low sexina a thank you for oh thanks for answering a question is great um oh and her real name is roshni and I'm 16 years old and admirers and oh and says that veganism cured her eczema - wonderful I'm so glad that your finger show better hacks I'm 21 says how have I been good thank you thank you so much Oh wonderful eight months eating healthy happier than ever that's what I like to hear wonderful um our gears raw vegan recovery asks what's the best mouthwash green tea with some Amla added that's what I that's right used for a mouthwash um and so if you type in mouthwash you all those videos will pop up the most important thing you stay away from antibiotic Michael um mouthwash is because you have these bacteria that live on your tongue that take the that label to use that nitrates that are pumped out in your salivary glands to give you all sorts of wonderful benefits from the nitrate rich in vegetables you eat but you below it you ruin all those wonderful nitrates from arugula or beetroot if you have killed off those good bacteria on your tongue so no antimicrobial mouthwash and the green tea and Amla which is dried Indian gooseberry powder you can just make your own Amma shake bottle um will help reduce your cavity risk I think that's why um that I made that concoction but you have checked the video to check it out all right um ooh so Rebecca says can a Crohn's patient eat bread so this is probably a a reference to video series I did about how Crohn's patients may want to reduce their intake of baker's yeast brewers yeast and nutritional yeast and so so yeah so thinking about baker's yeast um I so you one would have to either I guess an unleavened bread quick breads a matzah in order to cut down one's intake of yeast do we have so ya know so we um there's I know you gotta watch the series of videos I was really quite compelled so there's both hit ready hit ready - uh Pratibha one autoimmune disease and Crohn's disease would seem to improve I'm cutting down on yeast so now I used it as a way to curse people not to add go out of the way to add I'm used to the diet like I wouldn't be adding nutritional yeast to foods but yeah one could take that logical step to try to stay away from yeast all together to see if that improves your condition I mean so that would include most of yeast raised breads primo primo Zee oh I'm sorry I pronounce your name are there any news mmm is there any news about psoriasis and diet um yeah I think I read video about psoriasis I've just typed in psoriasis nutrition backdoor a little pop up um I think it was in relation oh it's escaping me now oh no check it out I think I do if I don't let me know in a month B might be yeah how do you feel coming up and I give you a sense of when that video will be out okay kealan ass is just a myth that cows milking leeches calcium from the bones yeah it's a mess cow's milk does not least calcium from the bones um even if it did it has so much calcium in it that overall calcium balance would be maintained yeah don't yeah calcium does not leach calcium from the bones cow's milk does not least calcium from the bones um and so I have a video with something about the titleist animal protein bones calcium something like that it'll go through the science sawing that that was a that was not that was a long-term misconception among this the general nutrition community that high protein intakes plead excess calcium loss and that's because hypertension intakes increased absorption of calcium pronounced so all this calcium that you're peeing out after eating a steak isn't coming from bones as I should coming from your diet predominantly and so that until we radioactively-labeled calcium we have no idea where the Caliph's come from and so no wonder we had this misconception but we've known better for many many years Jodie as to please do be about like to shock in oral elegy symptoms related to hay fever I think the only anaphylaxis videos I have about are the of those crazy Lone Star tick videos who gives people an allergy to red meat you get bitten by a tick and all of a sudden making it allergic reactions to eating meat I think of so many ones I have if anything pops up I will let you know that I think is is useful for a general audience skeezy schism willie asks says that that they've been eating a plant-based but still suffer from a fast resting heart rate and bad insomnia what would you do um so both are high

It’s got strong advantages. Taking one’s pulse is cheap, takes little time, it’s understandable to people, and it’s something everyone can do at home to measure their progress to become an active participant in their own health management. Every ten beats per minute increase is associated with a 10 to 20% increase in the risk of death. There seems to be a continuous increase in risk with increasing heart rate, at least for values above about a beat a second. So we can just look at our watch and if our heart is beating faster than the seconds go by— even when we’re sitting quietly, then we have to do something about it, especially when we start getting up around 80 or 90. Men with no apparent heart disease evidence with a pulse of 90 may have five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death— meaning their first symptom is their last— compared to those down the safety zone. Living up around 90 increases heart disease risk at a level similar to smoking. If you ask most doctors, though, 90 is considered normal. The accepted limits of heartrate have long been set at 60 and 100 beats/min. How did they come up with that? It was adopted as a matter of convenience just based on the scale of the squares on EKG paper. A historical accident like the QWERTY keyboard that just became the norm. 60 to 100 doesn’t even represent the bell curve. These cardiologists measured the heart rate of 500 people and concluded that 45 to 95 was a better definition of normal, rounding to 50 to 90, which a survey of leading cardiologists concurred with. Now we know that normal doesn’t necessarily mean optimal, but doctors shouldn’t be telling people with heart rates in the 50’s that they\'re are too low; in fact they may be right where they should be. Certainly a heart rate higher than 80 should ring an alarm bell, but what can we do about it? Exercise is one obvious possibility. Ironically, you make the heart go faster so that that the rest of the time your heart beats slower. The public health benefits of physical exercise, especially for heart protection, are widely accepted, and among the many biological mechanisms proposed to account for this risk-reducing effect is autonomic nervous system regulation of the heart. That’s your brain’s ability to slow down the resting beat of our heart. If you put people through a 12 week aerobic conditioning program of cycling, stairmaster, and running on a treadmill, you can drop their resting heart rate down from about 69 to about 66, so three beats per minute drop. Of course you have to keep it up; stop exercising and your resting heart rate goes right back up. Exercise is just one way to drop our heartrate, though. The way to our heart may also be through our stomach. What if instead of three months of exercise, you did three months of beans? A cup a day of beans, chickpeas, or lentils. The first randomized controlled trial of beans for the treatment of diabetes. And indeed successfully improved blood sugar control dropping A1C levels from 7.4 to 6.9, but this was also the first study to ever assess the effect of bean consumption on heart rate. And indeed one of the few to determine the effect on heartrate of any dietary intervention. This is particularly important in diabetics since having a higher resting heart rate not only increases the risk of death just like everybody else, but also appears to predict greater risk of diabetic complications, such as damage to the nerves and eyes. So how did beans do? A 3.4 beat drop in heartrate— just as much as the 250 hours on a treadmill. We’re not sure why beans are as powerful as exercise in bringing down one’s resting heart rate. In addition to the potential direct beneficial effects of all the good stuff in legumes, there is also the potential displacement value of reducing some of the animal protein foods by eating so many beans instead.

all these studies done on rats but the first human study was done on leave it was like five six cups of wild blueberries a day it was a pilot studies just wanted to see look can any amount of blueberries actually improve cognitive health and it did and there's a randomized control study you can give people powdered blueberries versus fake blueberry powder that looks like blueberry census and they same number cell calories and everything but it actually doesn't have anything blueberry in it that's how you can do read my specific control trials with berries and so but then finally and that's I have a new video coming out about the until now video of what about kind of doable level somewhere so they did one cup of blueberries and got significant improvements in various dimensions of cognitive function among older adults and works for kids too a really remarkable study how much was it I forget how many blueberries it was but they gave kids but not like you know eight weeks of a couple day of blueberries but one meal single meal goobers got significant boost in cognitive functions so like that's what you feed your kids in the morning they have their exams but literally within hours of consumption Romilly thinks the polyphenol phytonutrients actually go through the blood-brain barrier and can get into our brain have all sorts of wonderful Thanks so eat berries for your brain all right and lots of other stuff I've got a whole chapter on a brain disease in how not to die all proceeds from ourselves my books go to charity of course all right Linda Linda got my new cookbook yes let me know what you think Linda Shawna is back how much vitamin D Oh talked about that to destinations a day Austin years is back is me so healthy um me so healthy yes yes miso is a whole soy food and despite as I said and content is not associated with stomach cancer or high blood pressure as normally high sodium foods would be so yes it's healthy and that's actually what we use in the cookbook to make things salty and savory use miso use a whole food every single ingredient of every single recipe monitoring cookbook is health promoting it's a whole complan food a green light food all right Deborah what diet do I recommend for cats you need to ask a veterinarian I am a veterinarian but a very restricted one knowing only one species and that's almost a peon so can help you there Olivier is back what's the function oh we talked about the appendix all right Julia are there any foods that can help me establish a better sleeping pattern ooh ten net problems falling asleep yeah I actually do have I have videos on tart cherries but you bike and you can also buy and concentrate by whole can cherries and water and the on kiwifruit I don't know if that was the yellow kiwifruit a green kiwifruit in terms of sleep and I just did just scripted the video that's coming up that on on these melatonin and the problem with multum supplements is that if you actually go so the study looked at 31 brands off the shelves and the purity and the strength was completely off what some delayed well unfortunately our supplement industry so far the regulate you just cannot know what's in the bottle it says it has like there were some chewables that said at one point five milligrams of melatonin so chewables that's what kids might take actually had 9 milligrams that's like hundred times physiological normal levels and so and not just strength but purity found of these contaminants these under identified the contaminants some of which look surprisingly like that horrible tryptophan contaminant back in the 80s that killed dozens of people and sickened thousands again that's the problem with some in industry but but so wouldn't it be nice to get but so but the these studies show that ball tonin does actually help with sleep in high enough doses and so that's like if I had plateaus or five milligrams but you don't you take the supplements because of purity and potency issues so what do you do if only there was a best of both worlds way to do it if only melatonin was hard enough safe simple side-effect free solution food we've known since 1995 that plants have melatonin and which plants though I mean in enough that actually affects melatonin levels in the blood absolutely sorry there was I do have one state where talks about how you randomized people eating more vegetables less vegetable so you actually show they're more melatonin eating vegetables but almond but but the updated video talks about how they did these fruit studies they had people eat pineapples oranges I forget what the third one was anyway so you can you I mean you can show you can get these levels but the problem is so I was talking about jetlag and it's like you can't take a it's harder to pack a pineapple in your suitcase I'm is there anything like small you could do and so I talk about each food category how much melatonin is in each food so actually like look we make melatonin so animals deducing from melatonin and meat but with the highest melatonin meat is Sam and I think and you'd have to eat like 200 pounds of salmon and a single meal to get the mountain effect so that's that's a that's off the table whole grains there was a corn strain the yellow corn strain now eyes levels begin 16 years I mean a single meal way too much scratch dad the highest highest vegetable was white mushrooms and you only have to eat like forget it was like 2 pounds but 2 pounds of mushrooms like 10 cups of mushrooms because it's a light so all right scratch that so mushrooms have 100 times more than meat but still doesn't help you and then through cranberries to the rescue a single ounce single ounce of cranberries can give you a physiological dose of melatonin and but so you could actually do that you can do smoothie um so any in the evening you have a strawberry excuse me cranberry smoothie announce the cranberries like that's a cranberry um and and look you could actually travel with cranberries right they wouldn't smoosh through the but then what do you do when you get there right it's not like you can pack your blender with you too so thankfully tada a long story short pistachios the most nutrient excuse me melatonin rich nut pistachio smelled highest melatonin rich food anywhere like off-the-charts high levels of melatonin I'm to get a physical physiological serene is to to what you asked know to like to pistachios actually physiological those melatonin extraordinay so like a handful pistachios would be like a high dose melatonin supplement but without the contaminants etc anyway try that try the Kiwi froze tart cherries and pistachios and see and replug bag and tell me if you're sleeping better of course there's all sorts of sleep hygiene things I assume you're already doing dark and cold and you know all the things that help you sleep better anyway alright moving right along oh my got 10 minutes left I was just excited about this my all-time videos ok Laura asks you can get all they make three oh yeah what Lauren says you can get all your mega three to me from romaine lettuce that's so not true but if you need more search YouTube anyway um you know I mean as a percentage of fat I'm sure there's a lot of mega threes and romaine lettuce like there are in all greens but you know how much fat is in romaine lettuce it's not a lot of fat so it can be a hundred percent of mega threes you I mean you have seen a wheelbarrow presumably worth of romaine to get you know like two grams of al a day so I disagree respectively respectfully um Michelle asks Oh Michelle is talking to Julia roten as hi is it risky what causes it um I assumed wrote in his meaning MCB I'm on blood tests for vegans as a mean corpuscular volume yeah that could be a sign of vitamin b12 deficiency also be assigned a Foley deficiency but if you're vegan you probably get a lot of Foley because that's found in beans and greens China asked what's my opinion of a log diet and Chris people need both a combination of raw and cooked foods cooking actually improves nutrition of some vegetables because is not what you eat it's what you absorb and so you can you know quadruple the amount of beta-carotene in your bloodstream you didn't cook carrots great raw carrots and improves like a being human bioavailability and the red pigment tomato so process tomato products actually healthier than raw tomato products and on down the list but but raw foodist have it right that we should all sit down a big salads every day but you know I'd put the you know legumes and you know some you know beans canned beans and nuts and seeds and my delicious okay uh and if anyone for whatever reason really doesn't want to eat hundred percent wrong which I wouldn't recommend but if you do um you need to get a book called the coming raw by brenda davis entre molina my you could do it healthy it just takes a lot work Julie as fight something salty but I have it with kale with the harmful effects that certainly become a right by the healthy components of me aloo well in certain I mean so you simply salty I'd be bad for your blood pressure but eating that kale and broccoli that you mentioned in your question these are nitrate containing vegetables which actually improve my electric nitric oxide production can actually improve blood pressure his lower blood pressure so yeah it would actually counteract that negative effect but guess what but um but then you kind of cancel things out I mean don't you want to eat stuff that actually improves your health not just as neutral for your health that's why I would encourage you to eat the kale without the salt if you want something salty I mean ideally we you know look we don't add salt in the kitchen or the dining room table we don't eat processed foods which is where most of the salt comes from""), Document(metadata={'description': 'New subscribers to our e-newsletter

Michael Greger coming to you live from my treadmill like I do every month to answer any questions you may have this year I'm excited to answer your question in person in book signing lines in Q&A is 200 cities lined up although I've only got like 190 to go or something been on the road for a couple of weeks in Southern California in Arizona but hopefully we'll be in your town soon including countries like Poland and Denmark and Iceland for the first time ever I'm really excited in Denmark is crazy they had to open a whole bed like an 800 person theater they had to do a second thing because they sold out so quickly they're doing a whole second showing I guess I'm gonna do two back-to-back that is just so coolest place I've ever even been so I just I think speaks to the tremendous surge in interest in healthy eating so that's super exciting so that's the best part is seeing everybody of course all the travel and bad food and bad sleep is not the best part but I'll be done 10 months and off to write the next book how not to age anyway for those who are unfamiliar to every year I redo every issue of every English ladies nutrition journal the world so busy folks like you don't have to I think upon combined all the most interesting most groundbreaking most practical families and the new videos and articles upload every day nearly every day to my number I would say nutritionfacts.org everything on the website is what free there are no ads no corporate sponsorship strictly non-commercial not saw anything just put it up as a public service as a labor of love as a tribute to my grandmother new videos an article said free day nearly every day and latest an evidence-based nutrition what a concept alright let's start with your questions what's so nice about Facebook log as opposed to YouTube no YouTube I supposed to Facebook live is the questions don't move like you're putting your questions down and I just go in order I don't have to skip it and cuz it scroll up too quickly but um so let's do it number one Steve Parker why eliminate nutritional yeast I'm sorry if you've got that impression so on Facebook someone with hid retinitis support Eva says what should I cut out of my diet I said nutrition 'is there are two groups of individuals that should not eat nutritional yeast well three I guess one if you have an allergy which I've never heard of but on to is if you have had United subroutine v''e which is autoimmune condition as well as Crohn's disease why I've got videos on that just type in nutritionist and check it all out but for everybody else just say is perfectly fine and I had some for breakfast actually all right Carl Carl yeah Carl Cramer says any advice for loose skin and post big weight loss first of all congratulations on the big weight loss you will off so much weight you have loose skin that is a phenomenal feat keep up the good work but unfortunately the only thing new there are only surgical interventions in terms of cosmetic surgery to get rid of the excess flaps of skin and for everybody else not gain that much weight in the first place my synergy dance Dan CO or synergy dance acts how are the majority of longest-living people in blue zones doing so well despite eating meat fish dairy occasionally you just answered your own question because they only eat meat fish dairy occasionally so for example the Okinawan Japanese the second longest living population in the world of course this is when they weren't eating KFC like they are now they actually have some of the worst public health statistics now but in the 50s when they're reading how their more traditional diets they had like a 97% plant-based diet and so and really have that kind of a sweet potato vegetable based diet um the only people live longer than them only formerly study population is the seven day Adventists vegetarians Loma Linda California I just spoken love Linda that was a lot of fun and and they don't eat any meat at all and they're the only blue zone that actually like continues to be a blue zone right now these other these are historical examples they now westernized their diet so but the blue zone that is doing the best and continues to thrive is the one that doesn't eat any meat at all and living about a decade longer and general population Richard Strauss says what's the optimal dose is your vitamin E per day well dosage implies you're taking vitamin supplement want to do actually there's a study suggesting that those taking vitamin E supplements actually cut their lives short but you do need vitamin E but you should get it from natural sources like that's in seeds um why do Oh possible possibly right says why do we avoid mr. Solis I didn't say that I only said if you have Crohn's disease and or hidradenitis suppurativa everybody else feel free to eat your nutrition yeast in fact it's a way to get your vitamin b12 if it's fortified with b12 oh speaking of b12 ApS is duckweed a safe plant source for b12 and the answer is not until it's proven to be right I mean that's critically important all right vitamin b12 so the company that makes it or that packaged it that sells it purports on to show active b12 that is improvement until people with b12 deficiency are a given duckweed is a sole source and their b12 level recovers right there home assistant comes down if they're fully replete or they're methylmalonic acid level drops it's the only way right um so there's a lot of tests for b12 that don't necessarily show active b12 there are b12 analogs cause your body can't use fools our body actually they're like connect as anti b12 so you just do not want to mess around you can end up paralyzed demented or dead from a b12 deficiency so until it's proven to be a reliable source where they actually do a clinical study you could it's easy to find vegans low in b12 right because so many vegans are too stupid to not to to not supplement they are stupid for not supplementing and um so you put pretend of them twenty of them and give them some duckweed and see what happens and until then it's not a reliable source of b12 until it's proven to be a reliable source of b12 because it's not something you want to mess around with all right critically important all right and look even if they claimed that there's a bacteria that kind of lives in the duckweed that produce would be 12 let's say they do the study and they show that a batch of duckweed improves their their veto status okay that's great so you can you say that that batch of duckweed improves to be 12 it doesn't mean all duckweed or all the duckweed they even sell has active b12 maybe it has different bacteria that aren't making b12 at the moment so unless they can show reliably that whatever species of duckweed they have just always makes b12 that's always usable by people if that's not the case then you need to stick with supplements a vitamin b12 or vitamin b12 fortified foods okay Emily Paige Peron or posh a Peron says hi what you take on gluten flour homemade note well no salt say 1000 obviously so not a whole food but it's a green yellow or green light food um so it's a yellow light food it's the process plant food so it's a platform from which something bad good has been taken away or something bad has been added and here's this case nothing bad has been added but there has been something good taken away right you you know how to make seitan you wash away the fiber wash away some nutrition but but in terms of meat substitutes certainly better then you know everything else in the market right which has added sodium often added saturated fat of course what would be even better meets us to real whole food like legumes whole grains mushrooms these kind of things okay anyway tattooed woman asked please talk about nano volley pig in assists and how hard it is for the Oh for the body it turned carbohydrate into fat so tattooed women did not mean men denovo leap in Genesis she meant that de novo epigenesis so your body so it's true that if you over feed people calories it's easier to make people gain weight giving people fat calories in carbohydrate calories in fact you can make 100,000 College disappear by effective feeding people trying to over feed people carbohydrates opposed to fat I talked about this study but in long Vermont prisoners where they tried this experimental weight gain say they tried to get people to gain weight took one hundred thousand more calories on a mixed diet then then all fat died but but the problem it so but if you like you drink all ones if you drink a couple liters of soda a day even though you won't make a lot of fat you know where that fat is made that fat is made in your liver increases liver fat which is can dull the sensitivity to insulin in your liver and set you up for all sorts of badness so so yeah do not overeat my added sugars so yeah okay so even if it doesn't you're like oh it just puts a few grams of fat on your body huh yeah because where it is liver fat that's a bad thing increase your risk of fat liver disease again bad thing okay the chosen comment asks someone working in hospitals working for on for office it possible is it difficult to it is difficult to intermittent task I'm not eating the middle of night any recommendations I don't eat the middle of the night I mean that's there's not much you can do I mean there's all sorts of clonal biological badness that comes along with night shifts I'm like the light in the middle of the night that's not good but you can't do much about that but you can do something about eating so you don't eat it you still don't either die on you eat before you go to before you go to bed and in the morning or before you go to - - to work and in terms of well I'm gonna get so hungry going on that without food well you need to you know eat your thylakoids you

recommend colloidal silver in fact you can become silver poisoned by ingesting some people put it up their nose and you should not use silver internally you can get actually get a disease turns your skin strange color now is there a role for chloride or silver in topical applications outside the body perhaps in some rare circumstances of multi drug-resistant bacteria but that is not something that people should be using willy-nilly and certainly not internally I can't pronounce I'm so sorry I can't pronounce some of these names Joaquin so uh where'd you go okay stinky boom boom let's thank you boom boom asks I don't place a weird sticky boob no go I need to increase my the size of my chat window here okay I was so close to stinky boom-boom okay then it just disappeared I'm so sorry Ms boom-boom or mr. boom-boom okay I'm sorry I gotta go back to the bottom because it's growing up so quickly okay umm any story about BP and vegan Omar asks any story about BP blood pressure and a vegan diet absolutely I have a whole chapter on blood pressure in the book we've known since the nineteen twenties that high blood pressure need not occur my researchers measured the blood pressures at a thousand people living in rural Kenya published in The Lancet right of the most prestigious medical journal in the world 1929 and our blood pressures go up at we as we ate sets up a sixty the majority of us are hypertensive where is their eating a diet centered around fruits vegetables wild dark green leafy vegetables including and beans they're both pressures actually go down as they age in fact down to the ideal blood pressure so there's no benefit from reducing further blood pressure of 110 over 70 that's where we should all be working on and they got there naturally just eating healthy I miss anything with rural China 110 over 70 their entire lives 70 year old same average book pressures 16 year old and again what was you know what's the Venn diagram of the rural African nation diets it was plant-based that they need only not special occasions why do we things the plant-based nature their debts it was some protective because in the Western world according the American Heart Association the only folks getting it down that low are those eating strictly plant-based diets coming in average 110 over 65 so the to answer your question BP and vegan diets average 110 over 65 perfect ideal blood pressures so that's the nine people to go on and treat the cause if however you are on blood pressure medication you need to do this with supervision of your physician because they need to wrap it they may need to rapidly wean you off these blood pressure medications because you can't be on blood pressure man if you treat the call as eliminating our blood pressure can't be on blood pressure pills with normal blood pressure you drop your pressures too low you get dizzy fall over can hurt yourself so ironically the side effects are not having to take drugs or having to take fewer drugs so please work with your physician closely to wean yourself off these medications everything getting off completely and then not suffer the side effect and more importantly treat the cause of the disease okay any research on recovery for vegan athletes asked Ricky Kay with lots of question marks yeah I got a bunch of videos coming up on on on plant-based athletes and indeed that seems to be the key as the recovery time just because the anti-inflammatory nature of the diet it just allows people to to train that much harder but of course the secret is in the training not the diet the die just helps you enables you to train more but you still have to actually do the training no magic bullet all right Michael Stigall Stiggy Stigall SRU of course I'm to turn a treadmill on my walk about 17 miles a day of course tomorrow I'm gonna be in a plane on my butt all day but when I'm home if two of my diet roll of my life yes I'm on a treadmill day I'm working a treadmill desk I can you're a mound not tip to the camera down you'll see my well I don't know if you'll see then um that's my I got my keyboard I got my I got everything there um so yeah so then I can get work done does that actually show okay all right I knew I should have put pants on and yeah I'm treadmill because said being sedentary is not good for you even if you exercise even if you are you know go to the gym after work sitting down for six hours or more a day associated with living a significantly shorter lifespan I've got some videos about that check it out what is my input on the lemon first thing in the morning fine with me um I would just rinse your mouth out with water after eating that lemon or any citrus or any sour food so is not to a road your dental enamel okay Evan asks oh darn it Evan asked okay I'm not scroll up see if I'm ketchup yes should we limit soy intake I encouraged I think the sweet spot was three to five servings a day if I remember my own videos correctly because that high at two over five servings a day you can increase your levels of igf-1 insulin-like growth factor moments a cancer promoter growth hormone associated with animal protein consumption but enough soy protein you can get higher idea for on levels to which is not a good thing Elizabeth asks should humans fast that is a fantastic question there's a rich literature now I wanted to do fasting videos but there was just no science out there but now there's just been this burst of science and Clark restriction into meeting intermittent fasting water only fasting and also it's a really cool data and I can't wait to dig through and do a whole series of videos I hear you and the videos are coming subscribe at nutrition facts the bargain you will be the first to know when the first fasting video goes up alright how chloe Parker asks how do I feel about the work of ring Crowe nice I think Ray is a genius brilliant guy we share a lot of research anytime I come across a really interesting paper that I think would be helped it's work I send it to him he returns the favor he's got a book he's working a book called I think our broken plates something like that and I'm so excited for its release he's already published in the peer-reviewed medical Aries a former NASA engineer smart guy kind of reminds me of Pritikin right someone out of medical background just an engineering background and just wants to know the facts just show me the data and he's done a deep dive in the nutrition of literature and really has some fascinating stuff and I've done one video I think about his work I got a bunch more videos coming out about his work hey simple question as short films ABC macros what percentage the question is like should like 80/10/10 or what's the percentage of macronutrients from protein carbs and fat and the answer is it's the source that matters is dr. David Katz likes to say carbohydrates are lentils and lollipops so you can't say should eat more or less carbohydrates because what does that mean same thing with fat fat is lard if that is walnuts when the healthiest foods right you have talked about sources longer sources whole plant foods um I'm more interested with eating whole plant foods would then whether or not you're eating high or low fat or but you know so so as long as they're whole food source of fat and I talking about a while talking about and nuts seeds avocados those are health promoting foods I encourage people to eat up palmful actually uh nuts every day that's actually one of my daily doesn't another one is the tablespoon of ground flax seeds and so it's not it's fat good or bad it's the source whole food sources of fat carbs and protein or your best bet is okay t5 carrots a day ask Jackie it is okay to eat five carrots a day and even better dip those carrots and some bean dip or hummus or and time that you're making me hungry okay how can chem 2020s can your blood type dictate your eating habits I've got videos about the blood type diet or blood type astrology but that to me it seems the same as asking does my just my horoscope have anything to do with what I should eat and so the scientific community has been rightly very skeptical of that work and sees it more as a marketing gimmick than having any supportive at science um Maggie asked how can you increase your fertility actually very similar for both men and women it's eating a healthy plant-based diet though there was a the the Adventists too just had a sperm count diet that found I think that sperm counts of vegans was lower I have that that study doing everybody get just noted the the title abstract and I will do a video about it but in general I've got videos on fertility and low in saturated fat intake Siva soon someone in the plant-based would have improved fertility I will check out the study and letting you know what about a healthy vegan weight gain for strengthening athletes s Loukas so healthy if you add the word healthy in there then we're talking about whole plant foods um you know for athletes that are spending a lot of energy particularly swimmers they're just losing so much humanity EFT you know even thousands of extra calories a day you know that can be challenging on a plant-based diet because their foods are relatively clerkly dilute I mean you have to huge amounts of food now for most people that's a good thing it's hard just hard to get in excess of calories on a plant-based diet so great for weight loss but if you're actually trying to maintain a kind of endurance athlete my lifestyle where you know you're doing you know four or five thousand calories a day the way to do that is eat more eat more frequently even more calorically dense so we're talking nuts nut butters avocados smoothies you can kind of sneak liquid calories past your body and kind of fool the body a little bit so you know dried"")]","Based on the information provided in the transcripts, consuming dark green leafy vegetables can significantly improve heart rate variability (HRV). This is due to the beneficial effects these vegetables have on neuronal heart control. Therefore, for someone with a stressful job looking to improve their HRV through snacks, it would be beneficial to include snacks that are rich in dark green leafy vegetables.

Here are a few snack ideas that incorporate dark green leafy vegetables:

1. **Kale Chips**: Baked kale chips seasoned with a little salt and nutritional yeast can provide a crunchy, nutritious snack.

2. **Spinach and Hummus Dip**: Baby spinach leaves blended into hummus provide a flavorful dip that can be enjoyed with whole grain crackers or sliced vegetables.

3. **Green Smoothies**: A smoothie made with spinach, kale, a banana, and a splash of almond milk can be a refreshing and heart-healthy snack.

4. **Collard Green Wraps**: Use collard greens as a wrap filled with quinoa, diced vegetables, and a light dressing.

5. **Swiss Chard Mini Salads**: Toss small leaves of Swiss chard with nuts, dried cranberries, and a light vinaigrette for a quick, portable salad.

Incorporating these snacks into your daily routine can help improve HRV and provide a nutritious way to combat the effects of stress from a demanding job.","Based on the information provided in the transcripts, consuming dark green leafy vegetables can significantly improve heart rate variability (HRV).

Stick your hand out, thumbs up, feel for the knobby bone  at the top of your wrist. Then, if you slide your hand down  across the front of your wrist, you’ll feel these like  strands of spaghetti— those are the tendons in your wrist. If you lightly feel between the  knobby bone and that first tendon, you should feel your pulse. Got it? Okay, now we’re going  to feel what happens to our pulse when we take a deep breath. We’re going to try it twice. Try to feel what happens to  your pulse when you inhale, and when you exhale. All right, here we go— slow inhale… slow exhale. One more time… What happened when you  breathed in and breathed out? You should have felt your pulse  speed up when you breathe in and slow down when you breathe out -- that’s called heart rate variability, and it’s a very good thing. That’s a measure of the control  our nerves have over our heart. This is the survival curve for  people after a heart attack. With good heart rate variability, 9 out of 10 people are  still alive four years later. But with bad heart rate variability,  in that time period, half drop dead from sudden cardiac death. Is there anything we can do to improve our neurological  control over our heart? A landmark article this year in the  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that there was  only one type of food that could significantly improve  our heart rate variability. Is it citrus fruits, omega-3s, or dark green leafy vegetables? Let’s look at the graph. Here’s the level at which  statistical significance is reached. Let’s see which one makes it. Eating just a half serving  of greens every day significantly improved  neuronal heart control— which may be why studies in the past have suggested a quarter  cup of greens a day could cut our risk of having  a heart attack by 67%!

Taking one’s pulse is cheap, takes little time, it’s understandable to people, and it’s something everyone can do at home to measure their progress to become an active participant in their own health management. Every ten beats per minute increase is associated with a 10 to 20% increase in the risk of death. There seems to be a continuous increase in risk with increasing heart rate, at least for values above about a beat a second. So we can just look at our watch and if our heart is beating faster than the seconds go by— even when we’re sitting quietly, then we have to do something about it, especially when we start getting up around 80 or 90. Men with no apparent heart disease evidence with a pulse of 90 may have five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death— meaning their first symptom is their last— compared to those down the safety zone. Living up around 90 increases heart disease risk at a level similar to smoking. If you ask most doctors, though, 90 is considered normal. The accepted limits of heartrate have long been set at 60 and 100 beats/min. How did they come up with that? It was adopted as a matter of convenience just based on the scale of the squares on EKG paper. A historical accident like the QWERTY keyboard that just became the norm. 60 to 100 doesn’t even represent the bell curve. These cardiologists measured the heart rate of 500 people and concluded that 45 to 95 was a better definition of normal, rounding to 50 to 90, which a survey of leading cardiologists concurred with. Now we know that normal doesn’t necessarily mean optimal, but doctors shouldn’t be telling people with heart rates in the 50’s that they\'re are too low; in fact they may be right where they should be. Certainly a heart rate higher than 80 should ring an alarm bell, but what can we do about it? Exercise is one obvious possibility. Ironically, you make the heart go faster so that that the rest of the time your heart beats slower. The public health benefits of physical exercise, especially for heart protection, are widely accepted, and among the many biological mechanisms proposed to account for this risk-reducing effect is autonomic nervous system regulation of the heart. That’s your brain’s ability to slow down the resting beat of our heart. If you put people through a 12 week aerobic conditioning program of cycling, stairmaster, and running on a treadmill, you can drop their resting heart rate down from about 69 to about 66, so three beats per minute drop. Of course you have to keep it up; stop exercising and your resting heart rate goes right back up. Exercise is just one way to drop our heartrate, though. The way to our heart may also be through our stomach. What if instead of three months of exercise, you did three months of beans? A cup a day of beans, chickpeas, or lentils.

This is particularly important in diabetics since having a higher resting heart rate not only increases the risk of death just like everybody else, but also appears to predict greater risk of diabetic complications, such as damage to the nerves and eyes. So how did beans do? A 3.4 beat drop in heartrate— just as much as the 250 hours on a treadmill. We’re not sure why beans are as powerful as exercise in bringing down one’s resting heart rate.

BDNF controls the growth of new nerve cells, and “so, low levels [may explain the] atrophy of specific brain areas… [you see] among depressed patients.” That may be one of the reasons exercise is so good for our brains. Start an hour-a-day exercise regimen, and within three months you can get a quadrupling of BDNF release from your brain. This makes sense. Any time we were desperate to catch prey or desperate not to become prey ourselves, we needed to be cognitively sharp. And so, when we’re fasting or exercising and in a negative calorie balance, our brain starts churning out BDNF to make sure we’re firing on all cylinders. So, of course Big Pharma is eager to create drugs to mimic this effect, but is there any way to boost BDNF naturally? Yes, I just said it— fasting and exercise! Okay, okay, but is there anything we can add to our diet to boost BDNF? Well, higher intakes of dietary flavonoids appear to be protectively associated with symptoms of depression. The Harvard Nurse’s Study followed tens of thousands of women for years and found that those who were eating the most appeared to reduce their risk of coming down with depression. Flavonoids occur naturally in plants, and so there’s a substantial amount in a variety of healthy foods. But wait…how do we know the benefits are from the flavonoids and not just from eating healthier in general? You don’t know until you ... put it to the test. See, some fruits and vegetables have more than others. Apples have more than apricots, plums more than peaches, red cabbage more than white, kale more than cucumbers. So, if you randomize people into one of three groups: more high-flavonoid fruits and vegetables, more low-flavonoid fruits and vegetables, or no extra fruits and vegetables at all, after 18 weeks, only the high-flavonoid group got a significant boost in BDNF levels, which corresponded to an improvement in cognitive performance. The BDNF boost may help explain why each additional daily serving of fruits and  vegetables is associated with a three percent decrease in the risk of depression. A teaspoon a day of the spice turmeric may boost BDNF levels more than 50 percent within a month, consistent with the other randomized controlled trials that have so far been done. Nuts may help too. In the PREDIMED study where people were randomized to be sent weekly batches of nuts or extra virgin olive oil, the nut group lowered their risk of having low BDNF levels by 78 percent. And brain-derived neurotrophic factor is not just implicated in depression but schizophrenia as well. Have those with schizophrenia undergo a 12-week exercise program and they get a significant boost in BDNF levels, leading the researchers to suggest “that exercise induced modulation of BDNF may play an important role in developing non-pharmacological treatment for chronic schizophreni[a] patients.” Okay, but what actually happened to their schizophrenia symptoms? Let’s find out. Thirty individuals with schizophrenia randomized to ramp up to 40 minutes of aerobic exercise three times a week or not. And there did appear to be an improvement in psychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations, as well as increasing their quality of life. In fact, you can actually visualize what happened in their brains. Loss of brain volume in a certain region appears to be a feature of schizophrenia, but 30 minutes of exercise three times a week and you can get up to a 20 percent increase in size of that region within three months. Calorie restriction may also increase BDNF levels in schizophrenics, but they didn’t just have them eat less, but eat healthier— less saturated fat and sugar, and more fruits and veggies. It’s like the Soviet fasting trials for schizophrenia. They reported these truly unbelievable results, supposedly restoring people to function, fasting described as an “unparalleled achievement in the treatment of schizophrenia”. Okay, but part of the problem is that the diagnostic system the Soviets used is completely different, making any results hard to interpret. But they do have a subgroup that does seem to correspond to the Western definition, and they still report between 40 and 60 percent improvement rates from fasting. But that\'s not all they did. After being fasted for up to a month, they were put on a meat and egg-free diet, so when they report these remarkable effects even years later, that’s for those who stuck with the diet. Those who broke the diet evidently relapsed, and the closer the diet was followed the better the effect. They note that “not all patients [were able to] remain vegetarian,” but they tried to keep meat to a minimum. And look, we know from randomized controlled trials that just removing meat and eggs can improve mental states within even just two weeks, and so it’s hard to know what role the fasting itself played in the reported improvements. A single high-fat meal can drop BDNF levels within hours. And you can prove it’s the fat itself by seeing the same thing injecting fat straight into their veins. Perhaps that helps explain why increased consumption of saturated fats in a high-fat diet may contribute to brain dysfunction— neurodegenerative diseases, long-term memory loss, cognitive impairment. Maybe that helps explain why the standard American diet has been linked to a higher risk of depression, dietary factors modulating the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Certain foods are linked to not only increased happiness, but great “eudaemonic” well-being, feelings of engagement, creativity, meaning, and purpose in life. \n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Thousands of papers have been published on the important topic of what determines people’s happiness and psychological health, but what about the potential influence of the different kinds of foods that people eat? The rising prevalence of mental ill health is causing a considerable burden, and so inexpensive and effective strategies are required to improve the psychological well-being of our population. And now we have a growing body of literature suggesting that dietary intake may have the potential to influence psychological well-being. Dietary intake of what? Well, given the strong evidence base for the health benefits of fruits and vegetables, researchers started there. Cross-sectional studies from all over the world support this relationship between happiness and fruit and vegetable intake. Those eating fruits and vegetables each day had a higher likelihood of being classified as “very happy"", suggesting a strong and positive correlation between fruit and vegetable consumption and happiness. Perhaps feelings of optimism, too. The largest such study was done in Great Britain, where a dose–response relationship was found between daily servings of fruits and vegetables and both life satisfaction and happiness, meaning more fruits and veggies meant more happiness. People who got up to seven or eight servings a day reported the highest life satisfaction and happiness. And these associations remained significant even after controlling for factors such as income and illness and exercise, smoking and body weight, suggesting fruit and vegetable consumption wasn’t just acting as a marker for other healthy behaviors. But how could eating plants improve happiness on their own? Well, many fruits and veggies contain higher levels of vitamin C, which is a co-factor in the production of dopamine, the “zest for life” neurotransmitter. And the antioxidants reduce inflammation, which may lead to higher levels of eudaemonic well-being. Aristotle\'s notion of eudaemonia, described as the highest of all human goods, the realization of one\'s true potential, which was the aim of this study. They wanted to know whether eating fruit and vegetables was associated with other markers of well-being beyond happiness and life satisfaction, like greater eudaemonic well-being – a state of flourishing characterized by feelings of engagement, meaning, and purpose in life. So a sample of about 400 young adults were followed for about two weeks and indeed young adults who ate more fruit and veggies reported higher average eudaemonic well-being, more intense feelings of curiosity, and greater creativity. And they could follow this on a day by day basis— greater well-being on the days they ate healthier. These findings suggest that  fruit and vegetable intake is related to other aspects of human flourishing, beyond just feeling happy. Not so fast, though. Instead of eating good food leading to a good mood, maybe the good mood led to eating good food. Experimentally, if you put people in a good mood, they rate healthy foods like apples higher than indulgent foods like candy bars. Given a choice between M&M’s and grapes, individuals in a positive mood were more likely to choose the grapes. The results of these studies lend support to a growing body of research that suggests that positive mood facilitates resistance to temptation. Who needs comfort food when you’re already comforted? It’s like which came first, the chicken or the egg? Yes, eating eggs can increase our likelihood of chronic disease, but maybe chronic disease also increases our likelihood of eating unhealthy foods. Which came first, the mood or the food? What we need is a study like this, but instead of looking at well-being and diet on the same day, you see if there’s a correlation between what you eat today, and how you feel tomorrow. But we didn’t have a study like that… until now. They found the same strong relationships between daily positive mood and fruit and vegetable consumption, but lagged analyses showed that fruit and vegetable consumption predicted improvements in positive mood the next day, not vice versa. On days when people ate more fruits and vegetables, they reported feeling calmer, happier, and more energetic than they normally do, and they also felt more positive the next day. So, eating fruit and vegetables really may promote emotional well-being. Look, single bouts of exercise can elevate one’s mood, why not the same thing with healthy food? How many fruits and vegetables? Seems we need to consume approximately 7.2 daily servings of fruit or 8.2 servings of vegetables to notice a meaningful change.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Certain foods are linked not only to increased happiness, but also to greater “eudaemonic” well-being—feelings of engagement, creativity, meaning, and purpose in life.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

People who got up to seven or eight servings a day reported the highest life satisfaction and happiness. And these associations remained significant even after controlling for factors such as income and illness and exercise, smoking and body weight, suggesting fruit and vegetable consumption wasn’t just acting as a marker for other healthy behaviors. But how could eating plants improve happiness on their own? Well, many fruits and veggies contain higher levels of vitamin C, which is a co-factor in the production of dopamine, the “zest for life” neurotransmitter. And the antioxidants reduce inflammation, which may lead to higher levels of eudaemonic well-being. Aristotle\'s notion of eudaemonia, described as the highest of all human goods, the realization of one\'s true potential, which was the aim of this study. They wanted to know whether eating fruit and vegetables was associated with other markers of well-being beyond happiness and life satisfaction, like greater eudaemonic well-being – a state of flourishing characterized by feelings of engagement, meaning, and purpose in life. So a sample of about 400 young adults were followed for about two weeks and indeed young adults who ate more fruit and veggies reported higher average eudaemonic well-being, more intense feelings of curiosity, and greater creativity. And they could follow this on a day by day basis— greater well-being on the days they ate healthier. These findings suggest that  fruit and vegetable intake is related to other aspects of human flourishing, beyond just feeling happy. Not so fast, though. Instead of eating good food leading to a good mood, maybe the good mood led to eating good food. Experimentally, if you put people in a good mood, they rate healthy foods like apples higher than indulgent foods like candy bars. Given a choice between M&M’s and grapes, individuals in a positive mood were more likely to choose the grapes. The results of these studies lend support to a growing body of research that suggests that positive mood facilitates resistance to temptation. Who needs comfort food when you’re already comforted? It’s like which came first, the chicken or the egg? Yes, eating eggs can increase our likelihood of chronic disease, but maybe chronic disease also increases our likelihood of eating unhealthy foods. Which came first, the mood or the food? What we need is a study like this, but instead of looking at well-being and diet on the same day, you see if there’s a correlation between what you eat today, and how you feel tomorrow. But we didn’t have a study like that… until now. They found the same strong relationships between daily positive mood and fruit and vegetable consumption, but lagged analyses showed that fruit and vegetable consumption predicted improvements in positive mood the next day, not vice versa. On days when people ate more fruits and vegetables, they reported feeling calmer, happier, and more energetic than they normally do, and they also felt more positive the next day. So, eating fruit and vegetables really may promote emotional well-being. Look, single bouts of exercise can elevate one’s mood, why not the same thing with healthy food? How many fruits and vegetables? Seems we need to consume approximately 7.2 daily servings of fruit or 8.2 servings of vegetables to notice a meaningful change.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Diet and exercise synergize to improve endothelial function, the ability of our arteries to relax normally.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Rather than searching for the single magic bullet micronutrient, a more practical approach is likely to consider whole foods. Thus, increasing fruit and vegetable consumption is likely to have numerous beneficial effects due to synergistic effects of all the wonderful things in plants. Exercise helps too, but what type of exercise helps best? Patients were randomized into four groups: aerobic exercise (cycling for an hour a day), resistance training (using weights and elastic bands), both, or neither. The aerobic group kicked butt. The resistance group kicked butt. And the aerobic and resistance group kicked butt as well, compared to those who sat on their butts. Note that your endothelium doesn\'t care if you\'re on a bike or lifting weights, as long as you\'re getting physical activity. And getting regular activity.

After all, there\'s only so much you can make selling salad. For those who prefer plants to pills, one of the most anti-inflammatory foods is the spice turmeric. Researchers in Japan recently compared the endothelial benefits of exercise to that of curcumin, the yellow pigment in turmeric and curry powder. About a teaspoon a day\'s worth of turmeric for eight weeks compared to 30 to 60 minutes of aerobic exercise a day. Which group improved their endothelial function more? The group that did neither experienced no benefit, but the exercise group significantly boosted their endothelial function, and so did the curcumin group. The magnitude of the improvement achieved by curcumin treatment was comparable to that obtained with exercise. Therefore, regular ingestion of curcumin could be a preventive measure against cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women. Furthermore, their results suggest that curcumin may be a potential alternative treatment for patients who are unable to exercise, but ideally we\'d do both. In this study they looked at central arterial hemodynamics. Basically, if our endothelium is impaired, our arteries stiffen, making it harder for our heart to pump. But compared to placebo, we can drop that pressure down with turmeric curcumin or exercise, but if you combine both, then you really start rocking and rolling.

That's the focus of an emerging field of positive psychology focusing on happiness, life satisfaction, and flourishing, which may translate to physical benefits such as improvements in blood pressure, immune function, and longevity. What is the contribution of food consumption to well-being? Well, studies have linked the consumption of fruits and vegetables with enhanced well-being. A systematic review of research found evidence that consuming fruits and vegetables was associated with increased psychological well-being. Okay, but that's just an association. A famous criticism in this area of research is that maybe there's just some inherent personality trait or type of family upbringing that might lead people simultaneously to eat in a healthy way, and also to have better mental well-being. So the diet is merely correlated with, but incorrectly gives the appearance of helping to cause the level of well-being. But recent research circumvented this problem by seeing if changes in diet are correlated with changes in mental well-being, in effect studying the evolution of well-being and happiness after increases in the consumption of fruits and vegetables. And look at that graph—a straight-line increase between how much more fruits and veggies people started eating and their change in life satisfaction over time. Increased fruit and vegetable consumption appeared predictive of increased happiness, life satisfaction, and well-being— up to 0.24 life-satisfaction points for an increase of eight portions a day. What does that mean? Is that a lot? Is that a little? That's a lot, equal in size to the psychological gain of going from unemployed to getting a job. My Daily Dozen recommendation is for at least nine servings of fruits and veggies a day. This study was done in Australia. It was repeated in the UK, and researchers there found the same thing, though the Brits may need to bump up their daily minimum to more like 10 or 11 servings a day. Okay, but does eating fruits and veggies also reduce the risk of depression and anxiety? I mean well-being is nice, but governments and medical authorities are often interested in the determinants of major mental illness, not life satisfaction. And indeed, using the same data set but instead looking for mental illness, eating fruits and vegetables may help to protect against future risk of clinical depression and anxiety as well. A systematic review and meta- analysis of dozens of studies found that every 100-gram increased intake of fruit was associated with a 3% reduced risk of depression. That's about half an apple, yet less than 10% of most Western populations even consume a bare minimum. Maybe the problem is we're just telling people about the long-term benefits of fruit intake for chronic disease prevention, rather than the near-immediate improvements in well-being. So maybe we should be advertising the happiness gains, but first we need to make sure they're real. We've been talking about associations. Yes, a healthy diet may reduce the risk of future depression or anxiety, but being diagnosed with depression or anxiety today could also lead to lower fruit and vegetable intake. Now, in these studies you can indeed show that the increase in fruit and vegetable consumption came first, and not the other way around, but as the great enlightenment philosopher pointed out, just because the cock crows before the dawn doesn't mean the cock caused the sun to rise. To prove cause-and-effect you need to put it to the test with an interventional study. Unfortunately, to date many studies were like this, where those randomized to eat fruit showed significant improvements in anxiety and depression, fatigue, and emotional distress. Wow, amazing! But that was compared to chocolate and potato chips. Apples, clementines, and bananas making people feel better than assorted potato chips and chunky chocolate wafers—not exactly a revelation. This is the kind of study I've been waiting for: a randomized controlled trial in which young adults were randomized to a diet-as-usual group, encouragement to eat more fruits and veggies, or a third group given two servings of fruits and vegetables a day to eat over and above their regular diet. And the ones given fruits and veggies showed improvements in their psychological well-being with increases in vitality, flourishing, and motivation within just two weeks! However, simply educating people to eat their fruits and vegetables may not be enough to reap the full rewards, so perhaps greater emphasis needs to be placed on actually providing people with fresh produce, for example, offering free fruit for people when they shop. I know that would certainly make me happy!""), Document(metadata={'description': 'The effects of spinach and berries on oxidative stress, inflammation, and muscle soreness in athletes.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

What about the consumption of fruit and vegetables and risk of frailty in the elderly? Higher fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with lower frailty as well, in a dose-response manner, meaning more fruit less frailty, and more vegetables too, but these were all observational studies, which can’t alone prove cause-and-effect. What happens when you  put foods to the test? Well, no positive influence ingesting chia seed oil on human running performance, but there was an effect found for spinach supplementation on exercise-induced oxidation stress. And by spinach supplementation, they meant they just gave some guys some fresh raw spinach leaves, one gram per kilo, so like a quarter of a bunch a day for two weeks and then they had them  run a half marathon. And, they found that “chronic daily oral supplementation of spinach,” uh meaning like eating a salad, has alleviating effects on known markers of oxidative stress and muscle damage, Here’s what happens when you run a half marathon without spinach: a big spike in oxidative stress, blood malondealdehyde levels, that stay up hours or even days later. In the spinach group, the before and after 2 weeks of spinach doesn’t seem to make much of a difference, but put the body under pressure, and then you can really see the difference. Your body is better able to deal with the stress. And, if you look at the resulting muscle damage, as measured by creatine kinase  leakage from your muscles (that\'s an enzyme that should  be in your muscles, not leaking out into your blood), you start out at about 100 and go up to 200 after the half marathon, right after, 2 hours later. But it’s the next day where you really feel it, that delayed onset muscle soreness, with CK levels reaching 600 before coming back down. Okay, that’s without spinach, though. On spinach, you get a similar immediate post-race bump, but it’s that next day where spinach really shines. You don’t get that same next-day spike, and so, for a competitive athlete, that quicker recovery may get you back training harder sooner. They attribute this to the anti- inflammatory effects of spinach. Same with black currant juice. After some hardcore weight lifting, muscle damage indicators  go up and stay up, whereas the same lifting drinking berries, and it goes up, but  comes right back down. But these were just measures of a biomarker of muscle soreness. What about actual soreness? If you look at the effects of tart cherry juice on recovery following prolonged, intermittent sprints in soccer players, you see the same kind of reduction in biomarkers of inflammation, but more importantly, less resulting muscle soreness. Here’s the soreness reported in the days afterwards in the placebo group. Only about half in the cherry group. Then, they measured maximum voluntary isometric contractions of the leg muscles, which understandably took a hit in the days after the intense workout, but not in the cherry group. They conclude that participants supplemented with a tart cherry concentrate were able to maintain greater  functional performance. But, that was testing like how high can you vertically jump. They didn’t actually see if they played soccer any better. But, this study on purple grape juice actually showed an ergogenic effect in recreational runners by promoting increased time to exhaustion, where you ramp people up on a treadmill and see how long they  can go before collapsing. After a month of drinking a grape Kool-Aid type placebo control drink, no real change in performance, but a whopping 15% improvement in the real grape group– hung on for another 12 minutes. They used juice, so they could make a matched placebo control drink, but you can buy concord grapes fresh, or tart cherries fresh, frozen, or water-packed in a can. I mix them with oatmeal, cocoa, and mint leaves for a chocolate-covered- cherry type sensation. You may want to try that for a few days before participating in your next big sporting event.')]","Yes, there are foods that can enhance heart rate variability (HRV), particularly for someone practicing daily mindfulness exercises. According to the information provided, dark green leafy vegetables are identified as a type of food that can significantly improve heart rate variability. A study mentioned in the documents suggests that eating just a half serving of greens every day could significantly improve neuronal heart control, which is closely related to HRV. This improvement in HRV is linked to the potential reduction in the risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events.

Therefore, incorporating dark green leafy vegetables into the daily diet could be beneficial for enhancing HRV, especially when combined with mindfulness exercises that also support cardiovascular health.","Yes, there are foods that can enhance heart rate variability (HRV), particularly for someone practicing daily mindfulness exercises. According to the information provided, dark green leafy vegetables are identified as a type of food that can significantly improve heart rate variability. A study mentioned in the documents suggests that eating just a half serving of greens every day could significantly improve neuronal heart control, which is closely related to HRV. This improvement in HRV is linked to the potential reduction in the risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events.

Therefore, incorporating dark green leafy vegetables into the daily diet could be beneficial for enhancing HRV, especially when combined with mindfulness exercises that also support cardiovascular health.

We saw from the kiwifruit study  that this seemed possible,  but the mechanism they  suggested for the effect— the serotonin levels in kiwifruit,  doesn\'t make any sense,  since serotonin can\'t cross  the blood-brain barrier.  So you can eat all  the serotonin you want  and it shouldn\'t affect  your brain chemistry. A different brain chemical,  though, melatonin,  can get from our  gut to our brain. Melatonin is a hormone  secreted at night  to help regulate our  circadian rhythms  by the pineal gland in  the center of our brain.  Supplements of the stuff are used  to prevent and reduce jet lag and about 20 years ago  MIT got the patent  to use melatonin to  help people sleep.  Melatonin is not only produced  in the pineal gland, though,  but also is naturally  present in edible plants. That might explain the  results of this study,  the Effects of a Tart Cherry Juice Beverage  on the Sleep of Older Adults with Insomnia. The research group had been  doing an earlier study  on tart cherry juice  as a sports recovery drink.  See, there\'s a  phytonutrient in cherries  with anti-inflammatory effects  on par with drugs like  aspirin, ibuprofen,  so they were trying to  see if they could help  reduce muscle soreness  after exercise  and some of the participants  in the study  just anecdotally said that they were sleeping better  on the cherries. That was unexpected.  But the researchers  realized that  cherries are a plant food  source of melatonin,  so they put it  to the test.  The reason they chose  older subjects is that  melatonin production tends  to drop as we age,  which may be  one reason why  there\'s higher insomnia  rates in the elderly.  So, they took a group of  older men and women suffering from  chronic insomnia  and put half on cherries  and half on placebo.  Now they couldn\'t use whole  cherries for the study,  because how could  you fool people with a fake placebo cherry?  So they used cherry juice  versus ""cherry Koolaid,""  and found significant but  modest improvements in sleep,  so for example fell to  sleep a few minutes faster,  and had 17 fewer minutes of  waking after sleep onset,  meaning, waking up in  the middle of the night.  So it was no  insomnia cure,  but it helped without  side effects. How do we know it was  the melatonin, though?  They repeated the study,  this time measuring  the melatonin levels  and indeed saw a boost in  circulating melatonin levels after the cherry juice,  but not after the koolaid. Similar results were found  in people eating  the actual cherries— 7 different varieties,  boosting melatonin levels  and actual sleep times.  The effects of all the other  phytonutrients in cherries  can\'t be precluded,  maybe they helped too, but if it is the melatonin,  there are more potent  sources than cherries. Orange bell peppers  have a bit,  an ounce of walnuts.  A tablespoon  of flaxseeds  has about as much  as a tomato,  all less than the tart  cherries that were tested,  but people may eat a lot more  tomatoes than cherries,  especially tart cherries.  Sweet cherries have 50 times  less melatonin than tart  and dried cherries  appear to have none.  In fact, the melatonin  content of tomatoes  was suggested as  one of the reasons traditional Mediterranean  diets were so healthy.  A few spices are  pretty potent,  just a teaspoon of fenugreek  seeds or mustard seeds  has about as much  as a few tomatoes, but the bronze, silver,  and gold go to  almonds, raspberries, and  goji berries off the charts. Now even gojis just have  15 micrograms an ounce,  but melatonin is potent stuff.  You inject just  10 into people  and you can boost their blood  levels 50 fold in 5 minutes.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

After literally hundreds of  studies we still don\'t know  the best answer to  either question. A few years ago I featured a large  hundred thousand-person study suggesting that ""Both short  and long sleep duration""  ""were associated with  increased mortality""  with people getting around  7 hours of sleep living longest. Since then a meta-analysis  of all such studies  including more than a  million people was published,  and they found  the same thing.  We still don\'t know, though,  if sleep duration is a cause,  or simply a marker  of ill health. Maybe sleeping too  little or too long  does make you unhealthy, or maybe we see the associated  lifespan shortening  because being unhealthy causes you  to sleep shorter or longer. Similar work has now been published  on cognitive function.  After controlling for  a long list of factors,  men and women in their 50s  and 60s getting 7 or 8 hours  appeared to have the  best short-term memory,  compared to those that  got much more or much less.  Same thing was just demonstrated  with immune function:  ""both reduced and prolonged  habitual sleep durations""  ""were associated with an  increased risk of pneumonia"". It\'s easy to prevent over  sleeping-- set an alarm.  But what if your problem  is not getting enough?  What if you\'re the 1 in  3 adults that suffers  symptoms of insomnia?  Sure there are drugs like  valium you can take for insomnia in  the short term, but they have a number  of adverse side effects  and non-pharmacological approaches such as cognitive behavioral  therapy are often difficult,  time-consuming, and  don\'t always work.  Wouldn\'t it be great to  have ""natural treatments  ""that can improve both sleep  onset and help patients""  ""improve the quality of  sleep while improving""  ""next-day symptoms  over the long term""?  The ""Effect of kiwifruit consumption on  sleep quality in adults with sleep problems.""  Two kiwi fruit an hour before  bed every night for four weeks.  Why study kiwifruits?  Well, people with sleep  disorders tend to have high levels of oxidative stress  so maybe antioxidant  rich foods may help,  but all fruits and vegetables  have antioxidants.  Ah, but kiwifruits contain twice  the serotonin of tomatoes,  but it really shouldn\'t cross  the blood/brain barrier.  Kiwifruit has folate,  and a deficiency might cause insomnia,  but there\'s lots more folate  in some other plant foods.  The reason they studied  kiwifruits is because they got grant money  from a kiwifruit company,  and I\'m glad they did  because they found  some really remarkable results:  significantly improved sleep onset,  duration, and efficiency  using both subjective and  objective measurements.  Went from sleeping  6 hours a night to 7,  just eating a few kiwifruit.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'There may be a way to get the benefits of over-the-counter melatonin supplements without the risk.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

For these reasons,  melatonin supplements cannot be recommended. Too bad there’s no way you can get the benefits without the risks— unless, melatonin was  somehow found naturally in certain foods you could eat. Melatonin was first discovered in plants in 1995 and has since been found throughout the plant kingdom. But, enough that eating them actually affects your levels? Yes. You randomize people to eat more or fewer vegetables, and you can see the effect. Hard to get people to  eat vegetables though. How about beer? The melatonin present in beer contributes to an increase in the levels of melatonin in the human bloodstream. Though, alcohol consumption  may actually mess with your own endogenous melatonin secretion; so, beer probably isn’t the best choice. Eat two bananas, or drink the juice of about 2 pounds of  oranges or pineapple, and you can get significant bumps in melatonin concentrations in your blood, and the melatonin levels found in those fruits are pretty modest, compared to some other foods. Here’s the breakdown. The single food within each category with the highest recorded melatonin level, and how much you’d have to eat at one time to reach a physiological dose in your bloodstream. We make melatonin; so, it should come as no surprise that other animals do too. The most melatonin-rich meat tested was salmon, but because there were only billionths of a gram per serving, you’d have to sit down and eat about 200 pounds to get the effect. OK. So, forget meat. What about whole grains? The highest recorded was a strain of corn so rich in melatonin you’d only have to eat 16 ears of corn. All right, scratch that. What about other vegetables? Plain white button mushrooms  top the list. Only two pounds. A hundred times more  melatonin than meat, but still, they’re so light, 2 pounds is like eating 10 cups of mushrooms. That’s a lot in one sitting. Thankfully, cranberries to the rescue, the most melatonin-rich fruit. Just a single ounce, and it’s like you just took a melatonin supplement, with only good side effects, other than, of course, the extreme sourness. That’s about a third of a cup of cranberries. They’re pretty sturdy; so, you could travel without them getting smooshed, but what do you do with them once you get there. Easy to blend into a smoothie, but what if you’re stuck in a hotel? Can you eat dried cranberries, like what are they called—craisins? A study of various tart cherry products suggests that the drying process wipes out the melatonin; so, no melatonin in dried cherries and presumably dried cranberries either, nor in juice. The level of melatonin in cherry juice concentrate was almost nondetectable; so, drinking cranberry juice would also presumably be a wash, which brings us to nuts. Pistachios are not just the most melatonin-rich nut, they are simply off-the-charts as the most melatonin-rich food ever recorded. To get a physiological dose of melatonin, all you have to eat is two. Two what? Just two pistachios. Check it out; here are the data. More than 200 micrograms of melatonin per gram, point two milligrams per gram. And, you can get the normal daily spike your brain gives you by taking just 0.3 micrograms: so, just two nuts. So, taking a whole handful of pistachio nuts is like taking one of those high dose melatonin supplements. So, the best food for jet lag appears to be appropriately  timed pistachios.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Taking less than just 18 Ambien-class sleeping pills in an entire year may triple the risk of dying prematurely.\n\nIs Six Hours of Sleep Enough?

Even if that was all due to the difference in sleep, that\'s still only 6 pounds for 10,000+ more hours of sleep. If even a tiny fraction of that time was spent on diet and exercise, you know, biking to the nearest farm stand, more weight could have been lost in 16 weeks than in those 16 years. Every little bit helps, though, and getting at least seven hours is healthier for you anyway. This biggest reason to lose sleep over losing sleep is motor vehicle accident risk. Driving drowsy increases your risk of killing yourself and others. People might think twice about getting behind the wheel after staying awake for 48 hours straight, but even just two weeks of sleeping 6 hours a night impairs your cognitive performance as much as pulling two all-nighters in a row. So, what\'s the best way to sleep better? Sleeping pills are a nonstarter. Those prescribed even less than 18 pills a year of so-called hypnotics, the class of sleeping pills that includes Ambien, appear to have triple the risk of dying prematurely. Since up to 10% of the adult population is prescribed these drugs, if the drugs really are killing people, that could mean a six-figure death toll every year. Ambien\'s manufacturer questioned the study, but that\'s just one of dozens of studies that found a significant association between sleeping pills and premature death. When the principal investigator at the Scripps Clinic Sleep Center was criticized for reporting alarmingly high death risks from these commonly used medications, he replied: ""We can\'t hide risks, even if they might frighten patients out of taking hypnotics. Patients have a right to know."" What\'s more, non-pharmacological methods have been found to work as good or better than the drugs. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is what\'s called ""cognitive behavioral therapy, "" which combines conditioning techniques to re-associate the bed with sleep and education surrounding optimal sleep hygiene. Here are the four rules of sleep conditioning. (1) Go to bed only when you\'re sleepy. (2) Only use the bed for sleep (and sex). No reading, eating, or screen time. (3) If you can\'t fall asleep within about 15-20 minutes, get up, leave the bedroom, and don\'t come back until you\'re sleepy again. And repeat as necessary. And finally (4), get up at the same time every morning, no matter how little sleep you get. And although avoiding napping is often added, contrary to expectations, the majority of research does not show that daytime naps interfere with nighttime sleep. If there were four rules of sleep hygiene I\'d pick out, it would be (1): exercise regularly. The best time to exercise to improve sleep appears to be 4 to 8 hours before bedtime, though it appears to be a myth that exercising right before bed is somehow disruptive to sleep. (2) Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bedtime. We used to think as long as you don\'t drink caffeine in the evening, it wouldn\'t affect sleep, but four cups of coffee worth even six hours before bedtime can reduce total sleep time by more than an hour. Even just two cups in the morning at 7 a.m. can change what your brainwaves look like on EEG that night, though it\'s not clear if this has any clinical relevance beyond delaying the onset of sleep by an average of 10 minutes. Late afternoon alcohol consumption (6 hours before bedtime) may also impair sleep, even after it\'s cleared out of your system. And nicotine, whether from gum, pill, patch, or cigarette, can also have negative sleep effects, though so too can active nicotine withdrawal. Food-wise, low fiber intakes and high saturated fat and sugar intake is associated with lighter, less restorative sleep. Meat intake is associated with napping, suggested as a proxy for sleepiness. This may be one of the reasons insomnia has been reported as a side-effect of low carb, ketogenic diets. Supplement-wise, a single megadose of vitamin D was found to improve sleep duration and quality in men and women ages 20 through 50 with sleeping disorders. And I\'ve already talked about melatonin-rich foods and supplements in previous videos. (3) Make the bedroom quiet, dark, cool, and comfortable. Nocturnal noise can adversely impact sleep even if we\'re not consciously aware of it. Within a few days, you can become habituated to noises such that they don\'t wake you up, but EEG studies and subjective sleep surveys show the quality of your sleep can still be affected. Thankfully, ear plugs and sound masking, like white noise machines, have been shown to help. And finally (4), establish a relaxing bedtime routine. Relaxation techniques such as massage, mindfulness meditation, and soothing music may also help. So may taking a relaxing hot bath or shower. One of the reasons late-night eating can delay sleep is that it may interfere with the drop in core body temperature that normally occurs about bedtime. That\'s thought to be one of the cues that it\'s time for bed. So, should you not take a hot bath before bed? No, because as soon as you step out of the bath or shower, the rapid decline in skin temperature can accentuate the natural nighttime drop and improve sleep. Even just a warm foot bath may help you fall asleep about 15 minutes faster.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Foods for insomnia.

Force people to go one week with only six hours of sleep a night, and you can change expression of more than 700 genes. The most dire effect may be endothelial dysfunction. The endothelium is the thin layer of cells that covers the internal surface of blood vessels and is responsible for allowing our arteries to relax and dilate back open properly. Randomize people for about a week to get five rather than seven hours of sleep, and just that two-hour difference a night resulted in a significant impairment in artery function. Okay, but what do these numbers mean? How bad is a week of 5-hour nights? Sleep deprivation is no joke. The magnitude of impairment is similar to that reported in people who smoke, have diabetes, or have coronary artery disease. No wonder people who sleep less than seven hours a night may experience a 12% to 35% increased risk of premature death compared to those who get a full seven hours. Yet a significant proportion of the population may routinely get less than that. Sufficiently long, restful sleep sessions each night are said to be an indisputable cornerstone of good health. Okay, so what can we do about it? Those who have sleep apnea, a common consequence of obesity that interferes with sleep, benefit from the use of CPAP machines while they\'re losing the weight to treat the underlying cause, hopefully. But what if apnea isn\'t your problem? What if you just have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep? In my book How Not to Diet, I have a whole section on sleep enhancement, where I go through the Four Rules of Sleep Conditioning and the Four Rules of Sleep Hygiene. What if you follow those guidelines but still can\'t get to sleep? Any natural dietary remedies? I already have videos on using kiwifruit to fight insomnia, and tart cherries, too. Are there any vegetables that might help? Lactuca sativa is a plant that has been traditionally used in the treatment of insomnia. What is this exotic sounding leafy vegetable? Lettuce! Evidently lettuce extracts have been used from the time of the Roman Empire as agents with sedative and sleep-inducing properties. Lettuce actually does have a hypnotic substance in it called lactucin, which is what makes lettuce taste a little bitter. But you don\'t know if it actually works until you put it to the test. And it works...in toads. But it also works in rodents. Sleep in both mice and rats is enhanced by romaine lettuce. They used romaine since it has a higher lactucin content compared to other lettuces. Okay, but does it work in people? About 10 years ago, a study was published in which insomnia sufferers were randomized to receive lettuce seed oil, oil extracted from lettuce seeds. Within a week, about 70% of those in the lettuce seed oil group said their insomnia very much or much improved, compared to only 20% in the placebo control group. The researchers concluded that lettuce seed oil was found to be a useful, safe sleeping aid in geriatric patients suffering from sleeping difficulties. They chose to study older individuals because insomnia affects surprisingly 20 to 40% of older adults at least a few nights a month. You think that\'s bad. Sleep disturbances can plague as many as nearly 8 out of 10 women during pregnancy. Of course, there\'s lots of different sleeping pills, but they may endanger the fetus or mother. For example, doctors frequently prescribe Ambien for pregnant women who have trouble sleeping, but Ambien use is associated with a wide range of adverse pregnancy outcomes like low birth weight babies, premature birth, and cesarean section. And the use of valium during pregnancy has been linked to birth defects including limb deficiencies. There has to be a better way. What about trying lettuce? The lettuce oil study had a number of limitations. For example, it was only single-blind, meaning the researchers knew who was on the lettuce supplements and who was on placebo, which could have introduced some bias. But the researchers essentially said, ""Give us a break. Big pharma has billions to spend on research. No one wants to fund studies on lettuce."" Finally, we got a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, but this time on a whole food, not just a lettuce seed extract. Yeah, but how do you come up with a placebo lettuce? How are you going to hide who  gets lettuce and who doesn\'t? Well, you can\'t fit a head of lettuce into a capsule, but you can fit whole lettuce seeds. And here we go: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial on lettuce seeds for pregnancy-related insomnia. A hundred pregnant women with insomnia were randomized to receive capsules containing either a quarter teaspoon of ground lettuce seeds or a placebo for two weeks, and those on the lettuce seeds saw a significant improvement in a sleep quality index score compared to placebo with no reported side effects.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Did you know you can gain weight if you don’t get enough sleep?

Maybe high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. Well, there’s nothing I like better than bringing you the information that will help you do just that. Welcome to the Nutrition Facts Podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Michael Greger. Today, we discover the health benefits of sleep. And we start with the connection between the lack of sleep and weight gain. Population studies have found short sleep duration has been associated with obesity in both children and adults. Observational studies can never prove cause-and-effect, though. Maybe the obesity is leading to sleep loss instead of the other way around. Obesity can cause arthritis, acid reflux, and apnea, all of which can interfere with sleep. The relationship between obesity and sleep apnea, where your breathing repeatedly stops and starts throughout the night, may be explained by increased tongue fat—fat deposited inside the base of the tongue— that may contribute to obstructing your airway when you sleep on your back. The reverse causation explanation of the link between obesity and inadequate sleep is bolstered by the finding that weight loss interventions can improve daytime sleepiness. Potential confounding factors also abound. For example, people with lower socioeconomic status often work less desirable hours such as rotating or overnight shifts, or may live in noisier neighborhoods with poorer air quality, more crime. The link between inadequate sleep and obesity persists after controlling for these kinds of factors, but you can’t control for everything. You can’t know for sure if sleep deprivation leads to weight gain until you,...put it to the test. Have people pull an all-nighter and they get hungrier and choose larger portions. Randomize people to shave even just a few hours of sleep off every night and they start eating an average of 677 calories more a day compared to the normal sleep control group. Although individual responses vary widely, anywhere from eating 813 calories less per day to as many as 1,437 calories more, on average, studies found sleep deprivation led people to overeat by about 180 to 560 calories a day. Restrict people’s sleep and they also start craving unhealthier choices– more snacks, more foods that are fatty and sugary. Stick people in a brain scanner after staying awake all night, or after few nights of four-hour sleep, and their reward pathways light up brighter in response to high calorie foods. Sleep deprivation bumps the levels of the chief endocannabinoid in the body, the natural chemical we synthesize that binds to the same receptors as the active ingredient in marijuana. This may help explain the nighttime nibbling. On the calories outside of the equation, some short sleepers may take the extra time to exercise; others will be so sleepy they exercise less. The extra wakefulness may raise calorie expenditure up to about 100 calories a day, but if sleep-deprived individuals are overeating hundreds of calories, over time sleep deprivation may end up putting the “wide” in wide awake. With insufficient sleep inadvertently leading to such higher calorie intake, it’s no surprise that 4 out of 5 studies involving as few as 2–5 nights of sleep restriction found an increase in body weight. In other words, if you sleep less, you may gain more OK, but here’s where it gets crazy. Even if you control calorie intake, you still lose more fat when you get more sleep. Overweight subjects who normally got between 6.5 to 8.5 hours of sleep a night were randomized to two weeks of either 8.5 hours of sleep a night or 5.5 hours of sleep on the same calorie- controlled diet. Then the groups switched and spent another two weeks on the opposite regimen. So they spent a month living in the lab so their diets and sleep could be totally controlled and monitored. Just looking at the scales, sleep duration didn’t seem to matter, during both periods they ate the same number of calories and lost the same amount of weight, but most of the weight lost while getting 8.5 hours was fat, whereas most of the weight lost when only getting 5.5 hours of sleep a night was lean body mass. Same diet, but with more sleep they ended up losing more than twice as much body fat. So you snooze you lose… fat! In our next story, we discover how getting just one more hour of sleep a night may help with weight control. I featured a study that found that curtailing sleep can cut your rate of body fat loss in half, while exacerbating the loss of lean mass. To get better insight into what was going on, researchers took fat and muscle biopsies from people after a night of sleep loss. In terms of genes that were turned on and off, molecular signatures were discovered suggesting muscle breakdown and fat buildup. That was after an all-nighter, though, and in the weight-loss study the sleep-restricted groups ended up getting little more than 5 hours a night. What about a more realistic scenario like sleeping just like one hour less a night? Overweight adults were randomized to 8 weeks of a calorie restricted diet or the same diet combined with just 5 days a week of one hour a night less sleep. The sleep restricted group achieved the one hour a day less sleep on weekdays but ended up sleeping an hour more on the weekend days. So overall, they just cut about 3 hours of sleep out of their week. Would just those few hours a week make any weight loss difference? On the scale, no, but in the normal sleep group, 80% of the weight loss was fat, whereas in the group just missing a few hours of sleep a week it was the opposite— 80% of the loss was lean. This shows that a few hours of “catch up sleep” on the weekends is insufficient, and may in fact be contributing to the problem based on “social jetlag” effect I explored in a previous video. A comparable study was designed for kids, but the sleeping periods only lasted a week. Eight- to eleven-year olds were randomized to either increase or decrease their time in bed by 1.5 hours per night for a week and then switch the following week. They ate an average of 134 calories more on the days they slept less and gained in that week about half a pound compared to the sleep-more week. The question then becomes would sleeping more facilitate weight loss? When it comes to body fat, can we just, sleep it off? The benefit of interventional studies is that you can demonstrate cause and effect, but observational studies can allow you to more easily track people and their behaviors over a longer time span. For example, researchers followed a group of mostly overweight individuals who started out to averaging less than six hours of sleep a night for more than five years. During that time, about half maintained that schedule but the other half increased their sleep duration up to seven or eight hours a night and ended up gaining 5 pounds less fat. A study entitled “Sleeping habits predict the magnitude of fat loss” (among those cutting calories) found that every extra hour of sleep at night was associated with an extra 1-and-a-half pounds of weight loss over a period of about 3 to 6 months. That’s not the same as randomizing people to extra sleep, though. Maybe they were sleeping more because they were exercising more and that’s the real reason they lost more weight? Getting people to bump their sleep from about 5.5 hours up to 7 can lead to an overall decrease in appetite within two weeks, particularly for sugary and salty foods. A four-week study getting habitually short sleepers to sleep about an extra hour a night led them to consume about two fewer spoonful’s worth of sugar a day compared to the control group but this didn’t translate into any changes in body composition. A twelve-week study, on the other hand, randomizing overweight and obese individuals to a weight loss intervention with or without a sleep component found that the sleep group lost weight significantly faster. A national cross-sectional survey suggested lower obesity rates among kids in households that regularly ate dinner together as a family, got adequate sleep, and limited screen times, and so Harvard researchers decided to try to... put those behaviors to the test. A six-month randomized trial to improve household routines for obesity prevention among young children resulted in a lower BMI. Normally it’s hard to tease out the effects of multi-component interventions, but in this case exhortations to limit overall TV watching didn’t work, and the families were already eating together 6 days a week and so that didn’t change much either. The only thing they were able to get the kids to significantly alter was their sleep, and so the improved weight outcomes may be attributed at least in part to the ¾ hour average increase in nightly sleep. Overall, most sleep improvement interventions tended to show improved weight loss. I was intrigued to look up the one study that didn’t. The nice thing about systematic reviews (as opposed to so-called “narrative” reviews) is that they exhaustively include mention of every study that meets some prespecified criteria. This keeps reviewers from cherry-picking, but it can also lead to the inclusion of some strange studies. In this case, a randomized controlled trial of didgeridoo playing, the indigenous Australian wind instrument. Those randomized to the didgeridoo to improve their sleep quality did not lose any weight, but they also failed to improve the quality of their sleep (or, likely, that of their neighbors). Did you know that lactucin, the hypnotic component of lettuce, is a natural dietary remedy for insomnia? Here’s the story. There is a perception that time spent asleep is time wasted, but it is widely recognized that inadequate sleep is associated with multiple acute and chronic conditions, and results in the increased risk of death and disease.

The most dire effect may be endothelial dysfunction. The endothelium is the thin layer of cells that covers the internal surface of blood vessels and is responsible for allowing our arteries to relax and dilate back open properly. Randomize people for about a week to get five rather than seven hours of sleep, and just that two-hour difference a night resulted in a significant impairment in artery function. Okay, but what do these numbers mean? How bad is a week of 5-hour nights? Sleep deprivation is no joke.

This may help explain why studies show that those eating plant-based diets have superior mood states. This is the final video of a four-part series (mentioned in Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death [http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/]) on natural ways to boost serotonin in the brain.

Thursday's video The Wrong Way to Boost Serotonin (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-boost-serotonin/) was a cautionary tale about tryptophan supplements and Friday's video A Better Way to Boost Serotonin (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/a-better-way-to-boost-serotonin/) covered the role carbs can play in boosting tryptophan transport into the brain. The findings of better mood scores in those eating vegetarian is consistent with both cross-sectional (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/) and interventional (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-mood-through-diet/) findings I've reported previously. The reason I report more data on nuts than seeds is due to researchers' greater access to funding for studies involving nuts (thanks to producer groups). From what little data we have, though, I have a feeling it's like the soy versus other beans story (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-worth-a-hill-of-beans/). If I had to guess, I'd bet that, in general, seeds may be even healthier than nuts, and since I encourage daily nut consumption, I'd add seeds to that recommendation as well.

Since the main determinant of brain serotonin concentrations appears to be the ratio of tryptophan with others that compete with it for uptake into the brain, to maximize the mood- elevating effects of diet, one would ideally choose a snack with a high tryptophan-to-total protein ratio— which would mean primarily seeds, such as sesame, sunflower, pumpkin. “Protein-source tryptophan as an efficacious treatment for social anxiety disorder: a pilot study.” So, what protein source did they use? Butternut squash seeds, because of their high tryptophan-to-protein ratio, as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of people suffering from social phobia, also known as social anxiety disorder. And, they found significant improvement in multiple objective measures of anxiety in those eating the squash seed bars. Before studies like this one, “a change in the composition of intact dietary protein was not seen as a possible option for the treatment of common psychological disorders associated with low serotonin levels.” But, that’s because they were Using animal proteins (which can make things worse), not plants. If this is true, then those eating vegetarian should be golden. And, indeed, this was the reasoning used to explain why “Global mood… was significantly better in the ‘vegetarian’ than in the ‘mixed’ diet group.” It’s all about carbohydrates, and a huge tryptophan-to-protein ratio. “The vegetarian group was instructed to avoid meat, fish, and poultry and to restrict intake of milk, milk products and eggs to a minimum…” And, within three weeks, the vegetarian diet groups had a significantly improved global mood.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

But researchers at MIT dispelled those myths about a decade ago. Tryptophan is one amino acid among many found in proteins, and they all compete with one another for transport across the blood-brain barrier, into the brain. And, since tryptophan is present in most animal proteins in relatively small quantities, it gets muscled out of the way. If you eat plant foods, though, the carbohydrates cause a release of insulin, which causes your muscles to take up the non-tryptophan amino acids as fuel. And so, your tryptophan can be first in line for brain access. Animal foods can even make things worse: “When tryptophan is ingested as part of a protein meal, serum tryptophan levels rise, but brain tryptophan levels decline… due to the mechanism of transport used by tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier.” The tryptophan levels in those given a high-protein turkey, egg, cheese breakfast dropped, whereas in the waffle-OJ group, their tryptophan levels went up. This may actually explain the carbohydrate cravings one sees in PMS— your brain may be trying to get you to boost tryptophan levels to feel better. “Consumption of a carbohydrate-rich, protein-poor evening test meal during the premenstrual period improved depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, fatigue, alertness, and calmness scores [significantly] among patients with premenstrual syndrome.” “Because synthesis of brain serotonin, which is known to be involved in mood and appetite, increases after carbohydrate intake, premenstrual syndrome subjects may overconsume carbohydrates in an attempt to improve their dysphoric mood state.” Ideally, though, it would be more than just carbs— we’ll cover the ideal mixture in tomorrow’s video-of-the-day.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Sleep and weight loss: Even getting just one more hour of sleep a night may help with weight control.\n\nThis video was based on the sleep section in my book, How Not to Diet, which you can learn more about here (https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-diet/) (all proceeds go to charity), or check out my presentation based on the book: Evidence-Based Weight Loss (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-weight-loss-live-presentation/).\n\nIf you missed the previous video, see Does Lack of Sleep Cause You to Gain Weight?

On the scale, no, but in the normal sleep group, 80% of the weight loss was fat, whereas in the group just missing a few hours of sleep a week it was the opposite— 80% of the loss was lean. This shows that a few hours of “catch up sleep” on the weekends is insufficient, and may in fact be contributing to the problem based on “social jetlag” effect I explored in a previous video. A comparable study was designed for kids, but the sleeping periods only lasted a week. Eight- to eleven-year olds were randomized to either increase or decrease their time in bed by 1.5 hours per night for a week and then switch the following week. They ate an average of 134 calories more on the days they slept less and gained in that week about half a pound compared to the sleep-more week. The question then becomes would sleeping more facilitate weight loss? When it comes to body fat, can we just, sleep it off? The benefit of interventional studies is that you can demonstrate cause and effect, but observational studies can allow you to more easily track people and their behaviors over a longer time span. For example, researchers followed a group of mostly overweight individuals who started out to averaging less than six hours of sleep a night for more than five years. During that time, about half maintained that schedule but the other half increased their sleep duration up to seven or eight hours a night and ended up gaining 5 pounds less fat. A study entitled “Sleeping habits predict the magnitude of fat loss” (among those cutting calories) found that every extra hour of sleep at night was associated with an extra 1-and-a-half pounds of weight loss over a period of about 3 to 6 months. That’s not the same as randomizing people to extra sleep, though. Maybe they were sleeping more because they were exercising more and that’s the real reason they lost more weight? Getting people to bump their sleep from about 5.5 hours up to 7 can lead to an overall decrease in appetite within two weeks, particularly for sugary and salty foods. A four-week study getting habitually short sleepers to sleep about an extra hour a night led them to consume about two fewer spoonful’s worth of sugar a day compared to the control group but this didn’t translate into any changes in body composition. A twelve-week study, on the other hand, randomizing overweight and obese individuals to a weight loss intervention with or without a sleep component found that the sleep group lost weight significantly faster. A national cross-sectional survey suggested lower obesity rates among kids in households that regularly ate dinner together as a family, got adequate sleep, and limited screen times, and so Harvard researchers decided to try to... put those behaviors to the test. A six-month randomized trial to improve household routines for obesity prevention among young children resulted in a lower BMI. Normally it’s hard to tease out the effects of multi-component interventions, but in this case exhortations to limit overall TV watching didn’t work, and the families were already eating together 6 days a week and so that didn’t change much either. The only thing they were able to get the kids to significantly alter was their sleep, and so the improved weight outcomes may be attributed at least in part to the ¾ hour average increase in nightly sleep. Overall, most sleep improvement interventions tended to show improved weight loss. I was intrigued to look up the one study that didn’t. The nice thing about systematic reviews (as opposed to so-called “narrative” reviews) is that they exhaustively include mention of every study that meets some prespecified criteria. This keeps reviewers from cherry-picking, but it can also lead to the inclusion of some strange studies. In this case, a randomized controlled trial of didgeridoo playing, the indigenous Australian wind instrument. Those randomized to the didgeridoo to improve their sleep quality did not lose any weight, but they also failed to improve the quality of their sleep (or, likely, that of their neighbors).')]","Yes, incorporating certain foods into your diet can potentially help improve sleep quality. Based on the information from Dr. Michael Greger's videos, here are some foods that have been studied for their effects on sleep:

1. **Tart Cherries and Tart Cherry Juice**: Tart cherries are a natural source of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep cycles. Studies have shown that consuming tart cherry juice can modestly improve sleep quality in older adults with insomnia.

2. **Kiwifruit**: Consuming two kiwifruits one hour before bedtime may improve sleep onset, duration, and efficiency. This effect is possibly due to the antioxidant and serotonin content in kiwifruits.

3. **Nuts, especially Pistachios**: Pistachios are among the foods highest in melatonin. Just a small amount of pistachios can significantly increase melatonin levels, potentially aiding sleep.

4. **Seeds (Fenugreek and Mustard Seeds)**: These seeds have been noted to contain a good amount of melatonin, which might help in improving sleep.

5. **Goji Berries**: Also known as lycium berries, goji berries have a significant melatonin content, which may help in enhancing sleep quality.

6. **Lettuce Seed Oil**: Lettuce, particularly its seed oil, has been traditionally used to promote sleep due to its sedative properties, potentially from the substance lactucin.

7. **Almonds and Raspberries**: These are also good sources of melatonin.

8. **Flaxseeds and Walnuts**: These contain melatonin as well, though in smaller amounts compared to the other mentioned foods.

Integrating these foods into your diet may help enhance the quality of your sleep. However, it's also important to maintain good sleep hygiene practices alongside dietary changes for the best results. This includes maintaining a regular sleep schedule, creating a comfortable sleep environment, and avoiding stimulants close to bedtime.","Yes, incorporating certain foods into your diet can potentially help improve sleep quality.

For these reasons,  melatonin supplements cannot be recommended. Too bad there’s no way you can get the benefits without the risks— unless, melatonin was  somehow found naturally in certain foods you could eat. Melatonin was first discovered in plants in 1995 and has since been found throughout the plant kingdom. But, enough that eating them actually affects your levels? Yes. You randomize people to eat more or fewer vegetables, and you can see the effect. Hard to get people to  eat vegetables though. How about beer? The melatonin present in beer contributes to an increase in the levels of melatonin in the human bloodstream. Though, alcohol consumption  may actually mess with your own endogenous melatonin secretion; so, beer probably isn’t the best choice. Eat two bananas, or drink the juice of about 2 pounds of  oranges or pineapple, and you can get significant bumps in melatonin concentrations in your blood, and the melatonin levels found in those fruits are pretty modest, compared to some other foods. Here’s the breakdown. The single food within each category with the highest recorded melatonin level, and how much you’d have to eat at one time to reach a physiological dose in your bloodstream. We make melatonin; so, it should come as no surprise that other animals do too. The most melatonin-rich meat tested was salmon, but because there were only billionths of a gram per serving, you’d have to sit down and eat about 200 pounds to get the effect. OK. So, forget meat. What about whole grains? The highest recorded was a strain of corn so rich in melatonin you’d only have to eat 16 ears of corn. All right, scratch that. What about other vegetables? Plain white button mushrooms  top the list. Only two pounds. A hundred times more  melatonin than meat, but still, they’re so light, 2 pounds is like eating 10 cups of mushrooms. That’s a lot in one sitting. Thankfully, cranberries to the rescue, the most melatonin-rich fruit. Just a single ounce, and it’s like you just took a melatonin supplement, with only good side effects, other than, of course, the extreme sourness. That’s about a third of a cup of cranberries. They’re pretty sturdy; so, you could travel without them getting smooshed, but what do you do with them once you get there. Easy to blend into a smoothie, but what if you’re stuck in a hotel? Can you eat dried cranberries, like what are they called—craisins? A study of various tart cherry products suggests that the drying process wipes out the melatonin; so, no melatonin in dried cherries and presumably dried cranberries either, nor in juice. The level of melatonin in cherry juice concentrate was almost nondetectable; so, drinking cranberry juice would also presumably be a wash, which brings us to nuts. Pistachios are not just the most melatonin-rich nut, they are simply off-the-charts as the most melatonin-rich food ever recorded. To get a physiological dose of melatonin, all you have to eat is two. Two what? Just two pistachios. Check it out; here are the data. More than 200 micrograms of melatonin per gram, point two milligrams per gram. And, you can get the normal daily spike your brain gives you by taking just 0.3 micrograms: so, just two nuts. So, taking a whole handful of pistachio nuts is like taking one of those high dose melatonin supplements. So, the best food for jet lag appears to be appropriately  timed pistachios.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Bright light exposure synchronizes the central circadian clock in our brains, whereas proper meal timing helps sync the timing of the clock genes throughout the rest of our body.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

We\'ve known about the central clock, the so-called suprachiasmatic nucleus, for decades. It sits in the middle of your brain right above where your optic nerves cross, allowing it to respond to night and day. Now we know there are semi-autonomous clocks in nearly every organ in our body. Our heart runs on a clock, our lungs run on a clock, our kidneys run on a clock. Up to 80% of the genes in our liver are expressed in a circadian rhythm. Our entire digestive tract does too. The rate at which our stomach empties, the secretion of digestive enzymes, and the expression of transporters in our intestinal lining for absorbing sugar and fat all cycle around the clock. So too does the ability of our body fat to sop up extra calories. The way we know these cycles are driven by local clocks, rather than being controlled by our brain, is that you can take surgical biopsies of fat, put them in a petri dish, and still watch them rhythm away. All this clock talk is not just biological curiosity. Our health may depend on keeping all these clocks in sync. Think about it like a child playing on a swing. Imagine you\'re pushing, but you become distracted by other goings-on in the playground and stop paying attention to your timing. So you forget to push, or push too early, push too late. What happens? Out of sync, the swinging becomes erratic, slows, or even stops. That is what happens when we travel across multiple time zones or have to work the night shift. The pusher in this case are the light cues falling on our eyes. Our circadian rhythm is meant to get a bright light push every morning at dawn, but if the sun rises at a different time or we\'re exposed to bright light in the middle of the night, this can push our cycle out of sync and leave us feeling out of sorts. That\'s an example of a mismatch between the external environment and our central clock. Problems can also arise from a misalignment between the central clock in our brain and all the other organ clocks throughout our body. An extreme illustration of this is a remarkable set of experiments suggesting even our poop can get jetlag. Our microbiome seems to have its own circadian rhythm. Even though they\'re down where the sun don\'t shine, there\'s a daily oscillation in both bacterial abundance and activity in our colon. Interesting, but who cares? Check this out: if you put people on a plane and fly them halfway around the world, then feed their poop to mice, they grow fatter than mice fed preflight feces. Though it may have just been bad airline food or something, the researchers suggest the fattening flora was a consequence of circadian misalignment. Indeed, several lines of evidence now implicates chronodisruption— the state in which our central and peripheral clocks diverge out of sync— as playing a role in conditions ranging from premature aging and cancer, to mood disorders and obesity. Bright light exposure is the synchronizing swing pusher for our central clock. Well, what drives our internal organ clocks that aren\'t exposed to daylight? Food intake. That\'s why the timing of our meals may be so important. Removing all external timing cues by locking people away under a constant dim light, researchers showed you could effectively decouple central from peripheral rhythms just by shifting meal times. They took blood draws every hour and even took biopsies of their fat every six hours to demonstrate the resulting metabolic disarray. Just as morning light can help sync your central clock in your brain, morning meals can help sync your peripheral clocks throughout the rest of your body. Breakfast skipping disrupts the normal expression and rhythm of these clock genes themselves, which coincides with the adverse metabolic effects. Thankfully, they can be reversed. Take a group of habitual breakfast skippers, and have them eat three meals at 8 am, 1 pm, 6 pm, and their cholesterol and triglycerides improves, compared to taking meals five hours later at 1 pm, 6 and 11 pm. See, there\'s a circadian rhythm to cholesterol synthesis in the body too, which is also strongly influenced by food intake, as evidenced by the 95% drop in cholesterol production in response to a single day of fasting. That\'s why just a few hours shift in meal timing can result in a 20-point drop in LDL cholesterol, thanks to eating earlier meals.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

We saw from the kiwifruit study  that this seemed possible,  but the mechanism they  suggested for the effect— the serotonin levels in kiwifruit,  doesn\'t make any sense,  since serotonin can\'t cross  the blood-brain barrier.  So you can eat all  the serotonin you want  and it shouldn\'t affect  your brain chemistry. A different brain chemical,  though, melatonin,  can get from our  gut to our brain. Melatonin is a hormone  secreted at night  to help regulate our  circadian rhythms  by the pineal gland in  the center of our brain.  Supplements of the stuff are used  to prevent and reduce jet lag and about 20 years ago  MIT got the patent  to use melatonin to  help people sleep.  Melatonin is not only produced  in the pineal gland, though,  but also is naturally  present in edible plants. That might explain the  results of this study,  the Effects of a Tart Cherry Juice Beverage  on the Sleep of Older Adults with Insomnia. The research group had been  doing an earlier study  on tart cherry juice  as a sports recovery drink.  See, there\'s a  phytonutrient in cherries  with anti-inflammatory effects  on par with drugs like  aspirin, ibuprofen,  so they were trying to  see if they could help  reduce muscle soreness  after exercise  and some of the participants  in the study  just anecdotally said that they were sleeping better  on the cherries. That was unexpected.  But the researchers  realized that  cherries are a plant food  source of melatonin,  so they put it  to the test.  The reason they chose  older subjects is that  melatonin production tends  to drop as we age,  which may be  one reason why  there\'s higher insomnia  rates in the elderly.  So, they took a group of  older men and women suffering from  chronic insomnia  and put half on cherries  and half on placebo.  Now they couldn\'t use whole  cherries for the study,  because how could  you fool people with a fake placebo cherry?  So they used cherry juice  versus ""cherry Koolaid,""  and found significant but  modest improvements in sleep,  so for example fell to  sleep a few minutes faster,  and had 17 fewer minutes of  waking after sleep onset,  meaning, waking up in  the middle of the night.  So it was no  insomnia cure,  but it helped without  side effects. How do we know it was  the melatonin, though?  They repeated the study,  this time measuring  the melatonin levels  and indeed saw a boost in  circulating melatonin levels after the cherry juice,  but not after the koolaid. Similar results were found  in people eating  the actual cherries— 7 different varieties,  boosting melatonin levels  and actual sleep times.  The effects of all the other  phytonutrients in cherries  can\'t be precluded,  maybe they helped too, but if it is the melatonin,  there are more potent  sources than cherries. Orange bell peppers  have a bit,  an ounce of walnuts.  A tablespoon  of flaxseeds  has about as much  as a tomato,  all less than the tart  cherries that were tested,  but people may eat a lot more  tomatoes than cherries,  especially tart cherries.  Sweet cherries have 50 times  less melatonin than tart  and dried cherries  appear to have none.  In fact, the melatonin  content of tomatoes  was suggested as  one of the reasons traditional Mediterranean  diets were so healthy.  A few spices are  pretty potent,  just a teaspoon of fenugreek  seeds or mustard seeds  has about as much  as a few tomatoes, but the bronze, silver,  and gold go to  almonds, raspberries, and  goji berries off the charts. Now even gojis just have  15 micrograms an ounce,  but melatonin is potent stuff.  You inject just  10 into people  and you can boost their blood  levels 50 fold in 5 minutes.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'A cheat sheet to figure out exactly when and how to treat jet lag using light exposure and light avoidance at specific times of the day based on which direction you’re going and how many time zones you cross.\n\nLooking for healthy holiday meals?

Dehydration has been blamed. The air circulated in the cabins of commercial airlines is pretty dry. Yeah, it can make your throat, skin, and eyes feel dry. But, if you do the math, the maximum loss of fluid through like breath and sweat wouldn’t be more than like an extra half cup; so, it’s not like you’re in Death Valley or something, and that calculation assumes that the passenger would be nude, and I’m sure they’d charge extra for that. Of course, giving people salty pretzels doesn’t help. The vegetarian option tends to be healthier, if they’re serving meals, but you have to specify that when you book. BYOF — Bring Your Own Fruit — is a good rule to fly by, or unsalted nuts as a snack. The cabin air isn’t just dry, but low in oxygen pressure, about what you’d get 10,000 feet above sea level, like twice as high as Denver, and that alone can make you feel not-so-great. Then, when you land, if you’ve crossed enough time zones, you can suffer from jet lag, which is the temporary disconnect between the new time at your destination and that of your own internal body clock, which is still on home time. This is abnormal, since our internal clock is normally synced to the outside world, but the symptoms of jet lag go away as our body becomes hip to the new time. This usually takes, in days, two-thirds the number of time zones crossed eastwards, compared with half the number of zones crossed westwards. So, London is like 6 time zones east away from Chicago; so, flying there, it may take 4 days before you’re back to normal, whereas Londoners flying to Chicago should get over their jet lag in only 3 days. The reason it’s easier to go west, where the day is longer, than east is because our internal clock is naturally set for longer than 24 hours and has to be reset every day. That’s why they call the daily rhythm circadian, meaning about a day. In fact, you can see this in Major League Baseball performance. Researchers churned  through 40,000 games, mining 20 seasons and found surprisingly specific results of circadian misalignment— jet lag, and, indeed, the problems arose most after eastward travel with very limited effects after westward travel, consistent with the greater than 24-hour cycle length of the human circadian clock. OK. But, how do you treat it? First, you need to figure out if it needs treating at all. If you’re just traveling 1 or 2 time zones, you don’t have to worry about it. If you’re crossing three or more time zones, like traveling coast to coast, it then depends on how long you plan on staying. If it’s just a few days, it’s probably not worth treating it, since then you’ll have to switch back as soon as you get back home. If you have control over your schedule, it’s better to time appointments in the new time zone to coincide with daytime back home. So, it’s pretty much common sense. If you travel east, your body will still think it should be sleeping in the morning. So, you should push stuff later, and vice versa. But, if you are going to be gone for a while, you can adjust your body clock using behavioral methods and/or drugs, supplements, or foods. There is only one sure fire way to avoid jet lag altogether, and that’s to adapt to the new time zone before your trip. However, changing your home sleep schedule more than a few hours can be counter-productive by interfering with your pre-trip sleep, and you don’t want to be going into a long trip already sleep-deprived. Before your trip, you want to maximize your sleep. In flight, the recommendation is to immediately adjust to the destination meal schedule—easier said than done, and then, once you land, you want to try to maintain the destination sleep schedule. Try not to nap more than a few minutes, and you don’t want to be driving around when your body thinks it’s the middle of the night. But, the key to treating jet lag is light therapy. Going east, you expose yourself to the bright light in the morning and avoid bright light in the evening, and vice versa going west. But, it’s more complicated than that. The advice switches if you’ve traveling through more than six time zones, because your biological clock may then adjust in the wrong direction. And, it’s even more complicated than that! The effects of light acting upon the body clock is only actually during a specific window around the time your body temperature bottoms out: that\'s usually around 4 am. You drop from 98.6 down to like 97.6, even when you’re not sleeping— it’s just part of our circadian rhythm. The bottom line is here are the two cheat sheets you can take a snapshot of for future reference. So, for example, if you fly from LA to London, 8 time zones east, you’d avoid light between 6am and noon local time and expose yourself to light between noon and 6pm local, and the rest of the day, it doesn’t matter and won’t affect you either way. OK, now but that’s just on Day 1. On subsequent days, the local times of light avoidance and exposure need to be advanced earlier by 1 to 2 hours each day until light avoidance coincides with when you’re sleeping. But, on those first few days after traveling east, you’ll note you’re going to want to be avoiding morning light, which can be difficult, if that’s when your flight gets in. One thing you can do is wear really dark glasses until you get indoors, but if they’re too dark, you can’t really drive; so, that’s where these kind of ugly orange lenses that block blue wavelengths can come in handy, preventing the dip in melatonin you get just wearing regular sunglasses. Regardless, the next day, I know there’s the urge to get out and about, but that could actually make your jet lag worse by taking you in the opposite direction. What about if you’re flying more than 8 time zones east? Then, you subtract the number from 24 and treat it as travel west. So, a 10-time zone trip to the East, like New York to Delhi, should be treated as a westward flight, requiring a delay of the body clock, across 14 time zones. In that case, it would be easy to get outside and get some sun, but if you just went 4 time zones west and need to get light in the middle of the night, what do you do? A gadget company came up with like light-emitting headphones, the theory being you could bathe your brain in light directly through the ear canals. They stuck them on the heads of cadavers and did seem to get some light penetration, but you don’t know, until you… put it to the test. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial demonstrated that transcranial bright light exposure via the ear canals could alleviate jet lag symptoms, or you could just turn on a lamp.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'What shift workers can do to moderate the adverse effects of circadian rhythm disruption.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Graveyard shift, indeed! But is it just because they\'re eating out of vending machines or not getting enough sleep? Highly controlled studies have recently attempted to tease out these other factors by putting people on the same diets, with the same sleep, but just at the wrong time of the day. Redistributing eating to the nighttime resulted in elevated cholesterol, blood pressure, and inflammation. No wonder shift workers are at higher risk. Shifting meals to the night in a simulated night shift protocol turned about a third of the subjects effectively prediabetic in just 10 days. Our bodies just weren\'t designed to handle food at night. Just as avoiding bright light at night can prevent circadian misalignment, so can avoiding night eating. We may have no control over the lighting at our workplace, but we can try to minimize overnight food intake, which has been shown to help limit the negative metabolic consequences of shift work. When we finally do get home in the morning, though, we may disproportionately crave unhealthy foods. In this experiment, 81% of participants in a nightshift scenario chose high-fat foods such as croissants out of a breakfast buffet, compared to just 43% of the same subjects during a control period on a normal schedule. Shiftwork may also have people too fatigued to exercise, but even at the same physical activity levels chronodisruption can affect energy expenditure. Researchers found that you burn 12-16% fewer calories while sleeping during the daytime compared to night. Just a single improperly timed snack can affect how much fat you burn every day. Study subjects eating a specified snack at 10 am burned about 6 grams more fat from their body than on the days they ate the same snack at 11 pm. That\'s only about a pat and a half of butter\'s worth of fat, but it was the identical snack, just given at a different time. The late snack group also suffered about a 9% bump in their LDL cholesterol within just two weeks. Even just sleeping in on the weekends may screw up our metabolism. Social jetlag is the discrepancy in sleep timing between our work days and our free days. From a circadian rhythm standpoint, when we go to bed late and sleep in on the weekends, it\'s as we flew a few time zones west on Friday evening and fly back on Monday morning. Travel-induced jetlag goes away in a few days, but what might the consequences be of constantly shifting your sleep schedule every week over your entire working career? Interventional studies have yet put it to the test, but population studies suggest that those who have at least an hour of social jetlag a week, which may describe more than two-thirds of people, have twice the odds of being overweight. If sleep regularity is important, what about meal regularity? The importance of regular meals at roughly the same time every day was evidently emphasized by such luminaries such as Hippocrates and Florence Nightingale, but wasn\'t put to the test until the 21st century. A few population studies had suggested that those eating meals irregularly were at a metabolic disadvantage, but the first interventional studies weren\'t published until 2004. Subjects were randomized to eat their regular diets split up into 6 regular eating occasions a day, or 3 to 9 a day in an irregular manner. Researchers found that eating an irregular pattern of meals every day can cause a drop in insulin sensitivity and cause cholesterol levels to rise, and reduce the calorie-burn immediately after meals in both lean and obese individuals. They ended up eating more, though, on the irregular meals, and so it\'s difficult to disentangle the circadian effects. The fact that overweight individuals may overeat on an irregular pattern may be telling in and of itself, but it would be nice to see such a study repeated using identical diets to see if irregularity itself has metabolic effects. And just such a study was published in 2016. During two periods, people were randomized to eat identical foods in regular or irregular meal pattern. During the irregular period, people had impaired glucose tolerance, meaning higher blood sugar responses to the same food, and lower diet-induced thermogenesis, meaning burned fewer calories to process each meal. The difference in thermogenesis only came out to be about 10 calories per meal, and indeed there was no difference in weight changes over the two-week periods, but diet-induced thermogenesis can act as a satiety signal. The extra work put into processing a meal can help slake one\'s appetite. And indeed, lower hunger and higher fullness ratings during the regular meal period could potentially translate into better weight control over the long-term.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

After literally hundreds of  studies we still don\'t know  the best answer to  either question. A few years ago I featured a large  hundred thousand-person study suggesting that ""Both short  and long sleep duration""  ""were associated with  increased mortality""  with people getting around  7 hours of sleep living longest. Since then a meta-analysis  of all such studies  including more than a  million people was published,  and they found  the same thing.  We still don\'t know, though,  if sleep duration is a cause,  or simply a marker  of ill health. Maybe sleeping too  little or too long  does make you unhealthy, or maybe we see the associated  lifespan shortening  because being unhealthy causes you  to sleep shorter or longer. Similar work has now been published  on cognitive function.  After controlling for  a long list of factors,  men and women in their 50s  and 60s getting 7 or 8 hours  appeared to have the  best short-term memory,  compared to those that  got much more or much less.  Same thing was just demonstrated  with immune function:  ""both reduced and prolonged  habitual sleep durations""  ""were associated with an  increased risk of pneumonia"". It\'s easy to prevent over  sleeping-- set an alarm.  But what if your problem  is not getting enough?  What if you\'re the 1 in  3 adults that suffers  symptoms of insomnia?  Sure there are drugs like  valium you can take for insomnia in  the short term, but they have a number  of adverse side effects  and non-pharmacological approaches such as cognitive behavioral  therapy are often difficult,  time-consuming, and  don\'t always work.  Wouldn\'t it be great to  have ""natural treatments  ""that can improve both sleep  onset and help patients""  ""improve the quality of  sleep while improving""  ""next-day symptoms  over the long term""?  The ""Effect of kiwifruit consumption on  sleep quality in adults with sleep problems.""  Two kiwi fruit an hour before  bed every night for four weeks.  Why study kiwifruits?  Well, people with sleep  disorders tend to have high levels of oxidative stress  so maybe antioxidant  rich foods may help,  but all fruits and vegetables  have antioxidants.  Ah, but kiwifruits contain twice  the serotonin of tomatoes,  but it really shouldn\'t cross  the blood/brain barrier.  Kiwifruit has folate,  and a deficiency might cause insomnia,  but there\'s lots more folate  in some other plant foods.  The reason they studied  kiwifruits is because they got grant money  from a kiwifruit company,  and I\'m glad they did  because they found  some really remarkable results:  significantly improved sleep onset,  duration, and efficiency  using both subjective and  objective measurements.  Went from sleeping  6 hours a night to 7,  just eating a few kiwifruit.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Given the power of chronotherapy—how the same dose of the same drugs taken at a different time of day can have such different effects—it’s no surprise that chronoprevention approaches, like meal timing, can also make a difference.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

For billions of years, life on Earth evolved on a 24-hour cycle of light and dark, and so it\'s no surprise our bodies are finely tuned to that pattern. But put people in total darkness without any external time cues, and our body still continues to cycle in about a 24-hour circadian rhythm. In fact, you can even take tissue biopsies from people and show the cells continue to cycle outside the body in a petri dish. Nearly every tissue and organ in our body has its own internal clock. An intricate system of intrinsic clocks drives not only some of our behavioral patterns, such as eating, fasting, sleeping, and wakefulness, but our internal physiology—our body temperature, blood pressure, hormone production, digestion, and immune activity. Most of the genes in our body exhibit daily fluctuations in expression, making the circadian rhythm the largest known regulatory system in the body. This cycle is thought to allow for a level of predictability and functional division of labor so that each of our body processes can run at the best time. At night while we\'re sleeping, a whole array of internal housekeeping activities can be switched on, for example, and as dawn approaches our body can shift back into activity mode. Anyone who\'s ever had jet lag knows what throwing our cycle even just a few hours off can do, but now we know our circadian rhythms can literally be the difference between life and death. A study of more than 14,000 self-poisonings found that those who tried committing suicide in the morning were more than twice as likely to die than those who ingested the same dose in the evening. In the same vein, properly timed chemotherapy can not only end up being five times less toxic but also twice as effective against cancer. The same drugs, at the same dose, but different effects depending on the time that they\'re given. Our body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and eliminates what we ingest differently depending on when it is during the 24-hour cycle. We\'re just beginning to figure out the optimal timing for different medications. Randomize people suffering from hypertension into taking their blood pressure pills at bedtime instead of in the morning, and not only does the bedtime group achieve better blood pressure control and suffer fewer heart attacks and strokes, but cuts their risk  of death in half. Yet most physicians and pharmacists tell patients to take them in the morning, potentially doubling their risk of death. If chronotherapy—the optimal timing of drugs—can have such an impact, maybe it should come as no surprise that chronoprevention—the scheduling of lifestyle interventions like mealtimes— can also make a difference. In the official Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics position paper on effective treatments for obesity, importance is placed not only on the quantity but timing of calorie intake, suggesting that consuming more calories earlier in the day, rather than later in the day can assist with weight management. Some have gone further and even characterized obesity as a chronobiological disease. What evidence do we have to back up these kinds of claims? Well, the timing of calorie intake may have shifted slightly over the last few decades towards a greater proportion of food later in the day, which raised the question about a possible role in the rise of obesity. Middle-aged men and women who eat a greater share of daily calories in the morning do seem to gain less weight over time, and a study entitled ""Timing of food intake predicts weight loss effectiveness"" found that dieters eating their main meal earlier in the day seemed to steadily lose more weight than those eating their main meal later. The obvious explanation for these findings would just be that those who eat later also tend to eat more. And there does seem to be a relationship between when people eat most of their calorie intake and how many calories they end up eating over the entire day, with those eating a greater proportion in the morning eating less overall. Maybe later eaters are just overeating junk on the couch watching primetime TV? A tendency has been found for night owls to eat more fast food, soda, fewer fruits and vegetables. In the field of social psychology there\'s a controversial concept called ""ego depletion,"" where self-control is viewed as a limited resource like a muscle that can become fatigued from overuse. As the day wears on, the ability to resist unhealthy food choices may decline, leaving one vulnerable to temptation. So, is it just a matter of later eating leading to greater eating? Remember this study where earlier eaters steadily lost more weight? To their surprise, the early eaters were eating as much as the late eaters despite the difference in weight loss magnitude. The early eaters ended up about five pounds lighter than the late eaters by the end of the 20-week study, even though they were apparently eating the same amount of food. There didn\'t seem to be any difference in physical activity between the two groups either. Could it be that just the timing itself of calorie intake matters? Scientists decided to put it to the test, which we\'ll cover next.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Michael Greger coming to you live from my treadmill like I do every month to answer any questions you may have this year I'm excited to answer your question in person in book signing lines in Q&A is 200 cities lined up although I've only got like 190 to go or something been on the road for a couple of weeks in Southern California in Arizona but hopefully we'll be in your town soon including countries like Poland and Denmark and Iceland for the first time ever I'm really excited in Denmark is crazy they had to open a whole bed like an 800 person theater they had to do a second thing because they sold out so quickly they're doing a whole second showing I guess I'm gonna do two back-to-back that is just so coolest place I've ever even been so I just I think speaks to the tremendous surge in interest in healthy eating so that's super exciting so that's the best part is seeing everybody of course all the travel and bad food and bad sleep is not the best part but I'll be done 10 months and off to write the next book how not to age anyway for those who are unfamiliar to every year I redo every issue of every English ladies nutrition journal the world so busy folks like you don't have to I think upon combined all the most interesting most groundbreaking most practical families and the new videos and articles upload every day nearly every day to my number I would say nutritionfacts.org everything on the website is what free there are no ads no corporate sponsorship strictly non-commercial not saw anything just put it up as a public service as a labor of love as a tribute to my grandmother new videos an article said free day nearly every day and latest an evidence-based nutrition what a concept alright let's start with your questions what's so nice about Facebook log as opposed to YouTube no YouTube I supposed to Facebook live is the questions don't move like you're putting your questions down and I just go in order I don't have to skip it and cuz it scroll up too quickly but um so let's do it number one Steve Parker why eliminate nutritional yeast I'm sorry if you've got that impression so on Facebook someone with hid retinitis support Eva says what should I cut out of my diet I said nutrition 'is there are two groups of individuals that should not eat nutritional yeast well three I guess one if you have an allergy which I've never heard of but on to is if you have had United subroutine v''e which is autoimmune condition as well as Crohn's disease why I've got videos on that just type in nutritionist and check it all out but for everybody else just say is perfectly fine and I had some for breakfast actually all right Carl Carl yeah Carl Cramer says any advice for loose skin and post big weight loss first of all congratulations on the big weight loss you will off so much weight you have loose skin that is a phenomenal feat keep up the good work but unfortunately the only thing new there are only surgical interventions in terms of cosmetic surgery to get rid of the excess flaps of skin and for everybody else not gain that much weight in the first place my synergy dance Dan CO or synergy dance acts how are the majority of longest-living people in blue zones doing so well despite eating meat fish dairy occasionally you just answered your own question because they only eat meat fish dairy occasionally so for example the Okinawan Japanese the second longest living population in the world of course this is when they weren't eating KFC like they are now they actually have some of the worst public health statistics now but in the 50s when they're reading how their more traditional diets they had like a 97% plant-based diet and so and really have that kind of a sweet potato vegetable based diet um the only people live longer than them only formerly study population is the seven day Adventists vegetarians Loma Linda California I just spoken love Linda that was a lot of fun and and they don't eat any meat at all and they're the only blue zone that actually like continues to be a blue zone right now these other these are historical examples they now westernized their diet so but the blue zone that is doing the best and continues to thrive is the one that doesn't eat any meat at all and living about a decade longer and general population Richard Strauss says what's the optimal dose is your vitamin E per day well dosage implies you're taking vitamin supplement want to do actually there's a study suggesting that those taking vitamin E supplements actually cut their lives short but you do need vitamin E but you should get it from natural sources like that's in seeds um why do Oh possible possibly right says why do we avoid mr. Solis I didn't say that I only said if you have Crohn's disease and or hidradenitis suppurativa everybody else feel free to eat your nutrition yeast in fact it's a way to get your vitamin b12 if it's fortified with b12 oh speaking of b12 ApS is duckweed a safe plant source for b12 and the answer is not until it's proven to be right I mean that's critically important all right vitamin b12 so the company that makes it or that packaged it that sells it purports on to show active b12 that is improvement until people with b12 deficiency are a given duckweed is a sole source and their b12 level recovers right there home assistant comes down if they're fully replete or they're methylmalonic acid level drops it's the only way right um so there's a lot of tests for b12 that don't necessarily show active b12 there are b12 analogs cause your body can't use fools our body actually they're like connect as anti b12 so you just do not want to mess around you can end up paralyzed demented or dead from a b12 deficiency so until it's proven to be a reliable source where they actually do a clinical study you could it's easy to find vegans low in b12 right because so many vegans are too stupid to not to to not supplement they are stupid for not supplementing and um so you put pretend of them twenty of them and give them some duckweed and see what happens and until then it's not a reliable source of b12 until it's proven to be a reliable source of b12 because it's not something you want to mess around with all right critically important all right and look even if they claimed that there's a bacteria that kind of lives in the duckweed that produce would be 12 let's say they do the study and they show that a batch of duckweed improves their their veto status okay that's great so you can you say that that batch of duckweed improves to be 12 it doesn't mean all duckweed or all the duckweed they even sell has active b12 maybe it has different bacteria that aren't making b12 at the moment so unless they can show reliably that whatever species of duckweed they have just always makes b12 that's always usable by people if that's not the case then you need to stick with supplements a vitamin b12 or vitamin b12 fortified foods okay Emily Paige Peron or posh a Peron says hi what you take on gluten flour homemade note well no salt say 1000 obviously so not a whole food but it's a green yellow or green light food um so it's a yellow light food it's the process plant food so it's a platform from which something bad good has been taken away or something bad has been added and here's this case nothing bad has been added but there has been something good taken away right you you know how to make seitan you wash away the fiber wash away some nutrition but but in terms of meat substitutes certainly better then you know everything else in the market right which has added sodium often added saturated fat of course what would be even better meets us to real whole food like legumes whole grains mushrooms these kind of things okay anyway tattooed woman asked please talk about nano volley pig in assists and how hard it is for the Oh for the body it turned carbohydrate into fat so tattooed women did not mean men denovo leap in Genesis she meant that de novo epigenesis so your body so it's true that if you over feed people calories it's easier to make people gain weight giving people fat calories in carbohydrate calories in fact you can make 100,000 College disappear by effective feeding people trying to over feed people carbohydrates opposed to fat I talked about this study but in long Vermont prisoners where they tried this experimental weight gain say they tried to get people to gain weight took one hundred thousand more calories on a mixed diet then then all fat died but but the problem it so but if you like you drink all ones if you drink a couple liters of soda a day even though you won't make a lot of fat you know where that fat is made that fat is made in your liver increases liver fat which is can dull the sensitivity to insulin in your liver and set you up for all sorts of badness so so yeah do not overeat my added sugars so yeah okay so even if it doesn't you're like oh it just puts a few grams of fat on your body huh yeah because where it is liver fat that's a bad thing increase your risk of fat liver disease again bad thing okay the chosen comment asks someone working in hospitals working for on for office it possible is it difficult to it is difficult to intermittent task I'm not eating the middle of

Even if that was all due to the difference in sleep, that\'s still only 6 pounds for 10,000+ more hours of sleep. If even a tiny fraction of that time was spent on diet and exercise, you know, biking to the nearest farm stand, more weight could have been lost in 16 weeks than in those 16 years. Every little bit helps, though, and getting at least seven hours is healthier for you anyway. This biggest reason to lose sleep over losing sleep is motor vehicle accident risk. Driving drowsy increases your risk of killing yourself and others. People might think twice about getting behind the wheel after staying awake for 48 hours straight, but even just two weeks of sleeping 6 hours a night impairs your cognitive performance as much as pulling two all-nighters in a row. So, what\'s the best way to sleep better? Sleeping pills are a nonstarter. Those prescribed even less than 18 pills a year of so-called hypnotics, the class of sleeping pills that includes Ambien, appear to have triple the risk of dying prematurely. Since up to 10% of the adult population is prescribed these drugs, if the drugs really are killing people, that could mean a six-figure death toll every year. Ambien\'s manufacturer questioned the study, but that\'s just one of dozens of studies that found a significant association between sleeping pills and premature death. When the principal investigator at the Scripps Clinic Sleep Center was criticized for reporting alarmingly high death risks from these commonly used medications, he replied: ""We can\'t hide risks, even if they might frighten patients out of taking hypnotics. Patients have a right to know."" What\'s more, non-pharmacological methods have been found to work as good or better than the drugs. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is what\'s called ""cognitive behavioral therapy, "" which combines conditioning techniques to re-associate the bed with sleep and education surrounding optimal sleep hygiene. Here are the four rules of sleep conditioning. (1) Go to bed only when you\'re sleepy. (2) Only use the bed for sleep (and sex). No reading, eating, or screen time. (3) If you can\'t fall asleep within about 15-20 minutes, get up, leave the bedroom, and don\'t come back until you\'re sleepy again. And repeat as necessary. And finally (4), get up at the same time every morning, no matter how little sleep you get. And although avoiding napping is often added, contrary to expectations, the majority of research does not show that daytime naps interfere with nighttime sleep. If there were four rules of sleep hygiene I\'d pick out, it would be (1): exercise regularly. The best time to exercise to improve sleep appears to be 4 to 8 hours before bedtime, though it appears to be a myth that exercising right before bed is somehow disruptive to sleep. (2) Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bedtime. We used to think as long as you don\'t drink caffeine in the evening, it wouldn\'t affect sleep, but four cups of coffee worth even six hours before bedtime can reduce total sleep time by more than an hour. Even just two cups in the morning at 7 a.m. can change what your brainwaves look like on EEG that night, though it\'s not clear if this has any clinical relevance beyond delaying the onset of sleep by an average of 10 minutes. Late afternoon alcohol consumption (6 hours before bedtime) may also impair sleep, even after it\'s cleared out of your system. And nicotine, whether from gum, pill, patch, or cigarette, can also have negative sleep effects, though so too can active nicotine withdrawal. Food-wise, low fiber intakes and high saturated fat and sugar intake is associated with lighter, less restorative sleep. Meat intake is associated with napping, suggested as a proxy for sleepiness. This may be one of the reasons insomnia has been reported as a side-effect of low carb, ketogenic diets. Supplement-wise, a single megadose of vitamin D was found to improve sleep duration and quality in men and women ages 20 through 50 with sleeping disorders. And I\'ve already talked about melatonin-rich foods and supplements in previous videos. (3) Make the bedroom quiet, dark, cool, and comfortable. Nocturnal noise can adversely impact sleep even if we\'re not consciously aware of it. Within a few days, you can become habituated to noises such that they don\'t wake you up, but EEG studies and subjective sleep surveys show the quality of your sleep can still be affected. Thankfully, ear plugs and sound masking, like white noise machines, have been shown to help. And finally (4), establish a relaxing bedtime routine. Relaxation techniques such as massage, mindfulness meditation, and soothing music may also help. So may taking a relaxing hot bath or shower. One of the reasons late-night eating can delay sleep is that it may interfere with the drop in core body temperature that normally occurs about bedtime. That\'s thought to be one of the cues that it\'s time for bed. So, should you not take a hot bath before bed? No, because as soon as you step out of the bath or shower, the rapid decline in skin temperature can accentuate the natural nighttime drop and improve sleep. Even just a warm foot bath may help you fall asleep about 15 minutes faster.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Harness the power of your circadian rhythms for weight loss by making breakfast or lunch your main meal of the day.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

But who eats just one meal a day? What about just shifting our daily distribution of calories earlier in the day? Israeli researchers randomized overweight and obese women into one of two “isocaloric” groups, meaning each group was given the same number of total calories. One group was given a 700-calorie breakfast, a 500-calorie lunch, and a 200-calorie dinner; and the other group was given the opposite, 200 for breakfast, 500 for lunch, and 700 for dinner. Since they were all eating the same number of calories overall, the king-prince-pauper group should have lost the same amount of weight as the pauper- prince-king group, right? But no, the morning-slanted group lost more than twice as much weight, in addition to slimming about an extra two inches off their waistlines. By the end of the 12-week study, the king-prince-pauper group lost 11 more pounds (19 pounds lost compared to 8 despite eating the same number of calories). That’s the power of chronobiology, the power of our circadian rhythm. … 700, 500, 200 is 50% of calories at breakfast, 36% of calories at lunch, and only 14% of calories at supper. That’s pretty skewed. What about 20% for supper instead, a 50%-30%-20% spread, compared to 20-30-50? Again, the bigger breakfast group experienced “dramatically increased” weight loss, about nine pounds different in just eight weeks with no significant differences in overall calorie intake or physical activity between the two groups. Instead of 80%+ of calories at breakfast and lunch, what about 70% compared to 55%? Overweight “homemakers” were randomized to eat 70% of their calories at breakfast, a morning snack, and lunch, leaving 30% for an afternoon snack and dinner, or a more balanced 55% up through and including lunch. In both cases only a minority of calories were eaten for dinner. Would it matter if it was just 55% up through lunch or 70%? Yes, significantly more weight loss and slimming in the dietary pattern that was even more biased towards the morning. “Stories about food and nutrition are in the news on an almost daily basis, but information can sometimes be confusing and contradictory. Clear messages should be proposed in order to reach the greatest number of people,” the researchers conclude. And one clear communication physicians could give is “If you want to lose weight, eat more in the morning than in the evening.” Even just telling people to eat their main meal at lunch rather than dinner may help. Despite comparable calorie intakes, participants in a weight loss program randomized to get advice to make their main meal lunch, beat out those who instead were told to make their main meal dinner. The proverb “Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper” evidently has another variant: “Eat breakfast yourself, share lunch with a friend, and give dinner away to your enemy.” I wouldn’t go that far, but there does appear to be metabolic benefit to front loading the bulk of your calories earlier in the day. The evidence isn’t completely consistent, though. A review of dietary pattern studies questioned the role that reducing evening intakes would facilitate weight loss, citing this study that showed the evening-weighted group did better than the heavy morning meal group. Perhaps that was because the morning meal group was given for breakfast “chocolate, cookies, cake, ice cream, chocolate mousse and donuts.” So, chronobiology can be trumped by a junk food methodology. Overall, the “what” is still more important than the “when.” Caloric timing may be used to accelerate weight loss but doesn’t substitute for a healthy diet. When he said there was a time for every purpose under heaven, Ecclesiastes probably wasn’t talking about donuts.')]","To help reset the body clock for someone who has been traveling a lot and experiencing disruptions in their sleep schedule, it's beneficial to consume foods rich in melatonin, which is known for its role in regulating sleep cycles. According to Dr. Michael Greger's video ""How to Treat Jet Lag with Melatonin-Rich Food,"" certain foods naturally contain melatonin and can help increase melatonin levels in the blood, potentially aiding in sleep regulation. Here are some foods that are highlighted for their melatonin content:

1. **Pistachios**: They are exceptionally high in melatonin. Just consuming two pistachios could provide a physiological dose of melatonin, making them a potent choice for resetting the body clock.

2. **Cranberries**: Cranberries are also a good source of melatonin. However, fresh cranberries are recommended as the drying process tends to reduce melatonin levels significantly.

3. **Other Fruits and Nuts**: While pistachios and cranberries top the list, other fruits and nuts like cherries, almonds, and walnuts also contain melatonin, though in smaller amounts.

4. **Bananas and Oranges**: These fruits are modest sources of melatonin and can contribute to increased melatonin levels when consumed in larger quantities.

5. **Tart Cherries**: Tart cherry juice is known to improve sleep due to its melatonin content. It's beneficial to consume tart cherry juice a few hours before bedtime to help enhance sleep quality.

In addition to consuming these melatonin-rich foods, it's also important to expose oneself to natural light during the day and try to adhere to local meal and sleep times as quickly as possible after arrival to help reset the body's internal clock. This approach, combined with the dietary suggestions, can aid in quicker adjustment to new time zones and help stabilize disrupted sleep patterns.","To help reset the body clock for someone who has been traveling a lot and experiencing disruptions in their sleep schedule, it's beneficial to consume foods rich in melatonin, which is known for its role in regulating sleep cycles.

We saw from the kiwifruit study  that this seemed possible,  but the mechanism they  suggested for the effect— the serotonin levels in kiwifruit,  doesn\'t make any sense,  since serotonin can\'t cross  the blood-brain barrier.  So you can eat all  the serotonin you want  and it shouldn\'t affect  your brain chemistry. A different brain chemical,  though, melatonin,  can get from our  gut to our brain. Melatonin is a hormone  secreted at night  to help regulate our  circadian rhythms  by the pineal gland in  the center of our brain.  Supplements of the stuff are used  to prevent and reduce jet lag and about 20 years ago  MIT got the patent  to use melatonin to  help people sleep.  Melatonin is not only produced  in the pineal gland, though,  but also is naturally  present in edible plants. That might explain the  results of this study,  the Effects of a Tart Cherry Juice Beverage  on the Sleep of Older Adults with Insomnia. The research group had been  doing an earlier study  on tart cherry juice  as a sports recovery drink.  See, there\'s a  phytonutrient in cherries  with anti-inflammatory effects  on par with drugs like  aspirin, ibuprofen,  so they were trying to  see if they could help  reduce muscle soreness  after exercise  and some of the participants  in the study  just anecdotally said that they were sleeping better  on the cherries. That was unexpected.  But the researchers  realized that  cherries are a plant food  source of melatonin,  so they put it  to the test.  The reason they chose  older subjects is that  melatonin production tends  to drop as we age,  which may be  one reason why  there\'s higher insomnia  rates in the elderly.  So, they took a group of  older men and women suffering from  chronic insomnia  and put half on cherries  and half on placebo.  Now they couldn\'t use whole  cherries for the study,  because how could  you fool people with a fake placebo cherry?  So they used cherry juice  versus ""cherry Koolaid,""  and found significant but  modest improvements in sleep,  so for example fell to  sleep a few minutes faster,  and had 17 fewer minutes of  waking after sleep onset,  meaning, waking up in  the middle of the night.  So it was no  insomnia cure,  but it helped without  side effects. How do we know it was  the melatonin, though?  They repeated the study,  this time measuring  the melatonin levels  and indeed saw a boost in  circulating melatonin levels after the cherry juice,  but not after the koolaid. Similar results were found  in people eating  the actual cherries— 7 different varieties,  boosting melatonin levels  and actual sleep times.  The effects of all the other  phytonutrients in cherries  can\'t be precluded,  maybe they helped too, but if it is the melatonin,  there are more potent  sources than cherries. Orange bell peppers  have a bit,  an ounce of walnuts.  A tablespoon  of flaxseeds  has about as much  as a tomato,  all less than the tart  cherries that were tested,  but people may eat a lot more  tomatoes than cherries,  especially tart cherries.  Sweet cherries have 50 times  less melatonin than tart  and dried cherries  appear to have none.  In fact, the melatonin  content of tomatoes  was suggested as  one of the reasons traditional Mediterranean  diets were so healthy.  A few spices are  pretty potent,  just a teaspoon of fenugreek  seeds or mustard seeds  has about as much  as a few tomatoes, but the bronze, silver,  and gold go to  almonds, raspberries, and  goji berries off the charts. Now even gojis just have  15 micrograms an ounce,  but melatonin is potent stuff.  You inject just  10 into people  and you can boost their blood  levels 50 fold in 5 minutes.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'There may be a way to get the benefits of over-the-counter melatonin supplements without the risk.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

For these reasons,  melatonin supplements cannot be recommended. Too bad there’s no way you can get the benefits without the risks— unless, melatonin was  somehow found naturally in certain foods you could eat. Melatonin was first discovered in plants in 1995 and has since been found throughout the plant kingdom. But, enough that eating them actually affects your levels? Yes. You randomize people to eat more or fewer vegetables, and you can see the effect. Hard to get people to  eat vegetables though. How about beer? The melatonin present in beer contributes to an increase in the levels of melatonin in the human bloodstream. Though, alcohol consumption  may actually mess with your own endogenous melatonin secretion; so, beer probably isn’t the best choice. Eat two bananas, or drink the juice of about 2 pounds of  oranges or pineapple, and you can get significant bumps in melatonin concentrations in your blood, and the melatonin levels found in those fruits are pretty modest, compared to some other foods. Here’s the breakdown. The single food within each category with the highest recorded melatonin level, and how much you’d have to eat at one time to reach a physiological dose in your bloodstream. We make melatonin; so, it should come as no surprise that other animals do too. The most melatonin-rich meat tested was salmon, but because there were only billionths of a gram per serving, you’d have to sit down and eat about 200 pounds to get the effect. OK. So, forget meat. What about whole grains? The highest recorded was a strain of corn so rich in melatonin you’d only have to eat 16 ears of corn. All right, scratch that. What about other vegetables? Plain white button mushrooms  top the list. Only two pounds. A hundred times more  melatonin than meat, but still, they’re so light, 2 pounds is like eating 10 cups of mushrooms. That’s a lot in one sitting. Thankfully, cranberries to the rescue, the most melatonin-rich fruit. Just a single ounce, and it’s like you just took a melatonin supplement, with only good side effects, other than, of course, the extreme sourness. That’s about a third of a cup of cranberries. They’re pretty sturdy; so, you could travel without them getting smooshed, but what do you do with them once you get there. Easy to blend into a smoothie, but what if you’re stuck in a hotel? Can you eat dried cranberries, like what are they called—craisins? A study of various tart cherry products suggests that the drying process wipes out the melatonin; so, no melatonin in dried cherries and presumably dried cranberries either, nor in juice. The level of melatonin in cherry juice concentrate was almost nondetectable; so, drinking cranberry juice would also presumably be a wash, which brings us to nuts. Pistachios are not just the most melatonin-rich nut, they are simply off-the-charts as the most melatonin-rich food ever recorded. To get a physiological dose of melatonin, all you have to eat is two. Two what? Just two pistachios. Check it out; here are the data. More than 200 micrograms of melatonin per gram, point two milligrams per gram. And, you can get the normal daily spike your brain gives you by taking just 0.3 micrograms: so, just two nuts. So, taking a whole handful of pistachio nuts is like taking one of those high dose melatonin supplements. So, the best food for jet lag appears to be appropriately  timed pistachios.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

After literally hundreds of  studies we still don\'t know  the best answer to  either question. A few years ago I featured a large  hundred thousand-person study suggesting that ""Both short  and long sleep duration""  ""were associated with  increased mortality""  with people getting around  7 hours of sleep living longest. Since then a meta-analysis  of all such studies  including more than a  million people was published,  and they found  the same thing.  We still don\'t know, though,  if sleep duration is a cause,  or simply a marker  of ill health. Maybe sleeping too  little or too long  does make you unhealthy, or maybe we see the associated  lifespan shortening  because being unhealthy causes you  to sleep shorter or longer. Similar work has now been published  on cognitive function.  After controlling for  a long list of factors,  men and women in their 50s  and 60s getting 7 or 8 hours  appeared to have the  best short-term memory,  compared to those that  got much more or much less.  Same thing was just demonstrated  with immune function:  ""both reduced and prolonged  habitual sleep durations""  ""were associated with an  increased risk of pneumonia"". It\'s easy to prevent over  sleeping-- set an alarm.  But what if your problem  is not getting enough?  What if you\'re the 1 in  3 adults that suffers  symptoms of insomnia?  Sure there are drugs like  valium you can take for insomnia in  the short term, but they have a number  of adverse side effects  and non-pharmacological approaches such as cognitive behavioral  therapy are often difficult,  time-consuming, and  don\'t always work.  Wouldn\'t it be great to  have ""natural treatments  ""that can improve both sleep  onset and help patients""  ""improve the quality of  sleep while improving""  ""next-day symptoms  over the long term""?  The ""Effect of kiwifruit consumption on  sleep quality in adults with sleep problems.""  Two kiwi fruit an hour before  bed every night for four weeks.  Why study kiwifruits?  Well, people with sleep  disorders tend to have high levels of oxidative stress  so maybe antioxidant  rich foods may help,  but all fruits and vegetables  have antioxidants.  Ah, but kiwifruits contain twice  the serotonin of tomatoes,  but it really shouldn\'t cross  the blood/brain barrier.  Kiwifruit has folate,  and a deficiency might cause insomnia,  but there\'s lots more folate  in some other plant foods.  The reason they studied  kiwifruits is because they got grant money  from a kiwifruit company,  and I\'m glad they did  because they found  some really remarkable results:  significantly improved sleep onset,  duration, and efficiency  using both subjective and  objective measurements.  Went from sleeping  6 hours a night to 7,  just eating a few kiwifruit.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Taking less than just 18 Ambien-class sleeping pills in an entire year may triple the risk of dying prematurely.\n\nIs Six Hours of Sleep Enough?

Even if that was all due to the difference in sleep, that\'s still only 6 pounds for 10,000+ more hours of sleep. If even a tiny fraction of that time was spent on diet and exercise, you know, biking to the nearest farm stand, more weight could have been lost in 16 weeks than in those 16 years. Every little bit helps, though, and getting at least seven hours is healthier for you anyway. This biggest reason to lose sleep over losing sleep is motor vehicle accident risk. Driving drowsy increases your risk of killing yourself and others. People might think twice about getting behind the wheel after staying awake for 48 hours straight, but even just two weeks of sleeping 6 hours a night impairs your cognitive performance as much as pulling two all-nighters in a row. So, what\'s the best way to sleep better? Sleeping pills are a nonstarter. Those prescribed even less than 18 pills a year of so-called hypnotics, the class of sleeping pills that includes Ambien, appear to have triple the risk of dying prematurely. Since up to 10% of the adult population is prescribed these drugs, if the drugs really are killing people, that could mean a six-figure death toll every year. Ambien\'s manufacturer questioned the study, but that\'s just one of dozens of studies that found a significant association between sleeping pills and premature death. When the principal investigator at the Scripps Clinic Sleep Center was criticized for reporting alarmingly high death risks from these commonly used medications, he replied: ""We can\'t hide risks, even if they might frighten patients out of taking hypnotics. Patients have a right to know."" What\'s more, non-pharmacological methods have been found to work as good or better than the drugs. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is what\'s called ""cognitive behavioral therapy, "" which combines conditioning techniques to re-associate the bed with sleep and education surrounding optimal sleep hygiene. Here are the four rules of sleep conditioning. (1) Go to bed only when you\'re sleepy. (2) Only use the bed for sleep (and sex). No reading, eating, or screen time. (3) If you can\'t fall asleep within about 15-20 minutes, get up, leave the bedroom, and don\'t come back until you\'re sleepy again. And repeat as necessary. And finally (4), get up at the same time every morning, no matter how little sleep you get. And although avoiding napping is often added, contrary to expectations, the majority of research does not show that daytime naps interfere with nighttime sleep. If there were four rules of sleep hygiene I\'d pick out, it would be (1): exercise regularly. The best time to exercise to improve sleep appears to be 4 to 8 hours before bedtime, though it appears to be a myth that exercising right before bed is somehow disruptive to sleep. (2) Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bedtime. We used to think as long as you don\'t drink caffeine in the evening, it wouldn\'t affect sleep, but four cups of coffee worth even six hours before bedtime can reduce total sleep time by more than an hour. Even just two cups in the morning at 7 a.m. can change what your brainwaves look like on EEG that night, though it\'s not clear if this has any clinical relevance beyond delaying the onset of sleep by an average of 10 minutes. Late afternoon alcohol consumption (6 hours before bedtime) may also impair sleep, even after it\'s cleared out of your system. And nicotine, whether from gum, pill, patch, or cigarette, can also have negative sleep effects, though so too can active nicotine withdrawal. Food-wise, low fiber intakes and high saturated fat and sugar intake is associated with lighter, less restorative sleep. Meat intake is associated with napping, suggested as a proxy for sleepiness. This may be one of the reasons insomnia has been reported as a side-effect of low carb, ketogenic diets. Supplement-wise, a single megadose of vitamin D was found to improve sleep duration and quality in men and women ages 20 through 50 with sleeping disorders. And I\'ve already talked about melatonin-rich foods and supplements in previous videos. (3) Make the bedroom quiet, dark, cool, and comfortable. Nocturnal noise can adversely impact sleep even if we\'re not consciously aware of it. Within a few days, you can become habituated to noises such that they don\'t wake you up, but EEG studies and subjective sleep surveys show the quality of your sleep can still be affected. Thankfully, ear plugs and sound masking, like white noise machines, have been shown to help. And finally (4), establish a relaxing bedtime routine. Relaxation techniques such as massage, mindfulness meditation, and soothing music may also help. So may taking a relaxing hot bath or shower. One of the reasons late-night eating can delay sleep is that it may interfere with the drop in core body temperature that normally occurs about bedtime. That\'s thought to be one of the cues that it\'s time for bed. So, should you not take a hot bath before bed? No, because as soon as you step out of the bath or shower, the rapid decline in skin temperature can accentuate the natural nighttime drop and improve sleep. Even just a warm foot bath may help you fall asleep about 15 minutes faster.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Foods for insomnia.

Force people to go one week with only six hours of sleep a night, and you can change expression of more than 700 genes. The most dire effect may be endothelial dysfunction. The endothelium is the thin layer of cells that covers the internal surface of blood vessels and is responsible for allowing our arteries to relax and dilate back open properly. Randomize people for about a week to get five rather than seven hours of sleep, and just that two-hour difference a night resulted in a significant impairment in artery function. Okay, but what do these numbers mean? How bad is a week of 5-hour nights? Sleep deprivation is no joke. The magnitude of impairment is similar to that reported in people who smoke, have diabetes, or have coronary artery disease. No wonder people who sleep less than seven hours a night may experience a 12% to 35% increased risk of premature death compared to those who get a full seven hours. Yet a significant proportion of the population may routinely get less than that. Sufficiently long, restful sleep sessions each night are said to be an indisputable cornerstone of good health. Okay, so what can we do about it? Those who have sleep apnea, a common consequence of obesity that interferes with sleep, benefit from the use of CPAP machines while they\'re losing the weight to treat the underlying cause, hopefully. But what if apnea isn\'t your problem? What if you just have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep? In my book How Not to Diet, I have a whole section on sleep enhancement, where I go through the Four Rules of Sleep Conditioning and the Four Rules of Sleep Hygiene. What if you follow those guidelines but still can\'t get to sleep? Any natural dietary remedies? I already have videos on using kiwifruit to fight insomnia, and tart cherries, too. Are there any vegetables that might help? Lactuca sativa is a plant that has been traditionally used in the treatment of insomnia. What is this exotic sounding leafy vegetable? Lettuce! Evidently lettuce extracts have been used from the time of the Roman Empire as agents with sedative and sleep-inducing properties. Lettuce actually does have a hypnotic substance in it called lactucin, which is what makes lettuce taste a little bitter. But you don\'t know if it actually works until you put it to the test. And it works...in toads. But it also works in rodents. Sleep in both mice and rats is enhanced by romaine lettuce. They used romaine since it has a higher lactucin content compared to other lettuces. Okay, but does it work in people? About 10 years ago, a study was published in which insomnia sufferers were randomized to receive lettuce seed oil, oil extracted from lettuce seeds. Within a week, about 70% of those in the lettuce seed oil group said their insomnia very much or much improved, compared to only 20% in the placebo control group. The researchers concluded that lettuce seed oil was found to be a useful, safe sleeping aid in geriatric patients suffering from sleeping difficulties. They chose to study older individuals because insomnia affects surprisingly 20 to 40% of older adults at least a few nights a month. You think that\'s bad. Sleep disturbances can plague as many as nearly 8 out of 10 women during pregnancy. Of course, there\'s lots of different sleeping pills, but they may endanger the fetus or mother. For example, doctors frequently prescribe Ambien for pregnant women who have trouble sleeping, but Ambien use is associated with a wide range of adverse pregnancy outcomes like low birth weight babies, premature birth, and cesarean section. And the use of valium during pregnancy has been linked to birth defects including limb deficiencies. There has to be a better way. What about trying lettuce? The lettuce oil study had a number of limitations. For example, it was only single-blind, meaning the researchers knew who was on the lettuce supplements and who was on placebo, which could have introduced some bias. But the researchers essentially said, ""Give us a break. Big pharma has billions to spend on research. No one wants to fund studies on lettuce."" Finally, we got a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, but this time on a whole food, not just a lettuce seed extract. Yeah, but how do you come up with a placebo lettuce? How are you going to hide who  gets lettuce and who doesn\'t? Well, you can\'t fit a head of lettuce into a capsule, but you can fit whole lettuce seeds. And here we go: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial on lettuce seeds for pregnancy-related insomnia. A hundred pregnant women with insomnia were randomized to receive capsules containing either a quarter teaspoon of ground lettuce seeds or a placebo for two weeks, and those on the lettuce seeds saw a significant improvement in a sleep quality index score compared to placebo with no reported side effects.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Did you know you can gain weight if you don’t get enough sleep?

Maybe high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. Well, there’s nothing I like better than bringing you the information that will help you do just that. Welcome to the Nutrition Facts Podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Michael Greger. Today, we discover the health benefits of sleep. And we start with the connection between the lack of sleep and weight gain. Population studies have found short sleep duration has been associated with obesity in both children and adults. Observational studies can never prove cause-and-effect, though. Maybe the obesity is leading to sleep loss instead of the other way around. Obesity can cause arthritis, acid reflux, and apnea, all of which can interfere with sleep. The relationship between obesity and sleep apnea, where your breathing repeatedly stops and starts throughout the night, may be explained by increased tongue fat—fat deposited inside the base of the tongue— that may contribute to obstructing your airway when you sleep on your back. The reverse causation explanation of the link between obesity and inadequate sleep is bolstered by the finding that weight loss interventions can improve daytime sleepiness. Potential confounding factors also abound. For example, people with lower socioeconomic status often work less desirable hours such as rotating or overnight shifts, or may live in noisier neighborhoods with poorer air quality, more crime. The link between inadequate sleep and obesity persists after controlling for these kinds of factors, but you can’t control for everything. You can’t know for sure if sleep deprivation leads to weight gain until you,...put it to the test. Have people pull an all-nighter and they get hungrier and choose larger portions. Randomize people to shave even just a few hours of sleep off every night and they start eating an average of 677 calories more a day compared to the normal sleep control group. Although individual responses vary widely, anywhere from eating 813 calories less per day to as many as 1,437 calories more, on average, studies found sleep deprivation led people to overeat by about 180 to 560 calories a day. Restrict people’s sleep and they also start craving unhealthier choices– more snacks, more foods that are fatty and sugary. Stick people in a brain scanner after staying awake all night, or after few nights of four-hour sleep, and their reward pathways light up brighter in response to high calorie foods. Sleep deprivation bumps the levels of the chief endocannabinoid in the body, the natural chemical we synthesize that binds to the same receptors as the active ingredient in marijuana. This may help explain the nighttime nibbling. On the calories outside of the equation, some short sleepers may take the extra time to exercise; others will be so sleepy they exercise less. The extra wakefulness may raise calorie expenditure up to about 100 calories a day, but if sleep-deprived individuals are overeating hundreds of calories, over time sleep deprivation may end up putting the “wide” in wide awake. With insufficient sleep inadvertently leading to such higher calorie intake, it’s no surprise that 4 out of 5 studies involving as few as 2–5 nights of sleep restriction found an increase in body weight. In other words, if you sleep less, you may gain more OK, but here’s where it gets crazy. Even if you control calorie intake, you still lose more fat when you get more sleep. Overweight subjects who normally got between 6.5 to 8.5 hours of sleep a night were randomized to two weeks of either 8.5 hours of sleep a night or 5.5 hours of sleep on the same calorie- controlled diet. Then the groups switched and spent another two weeks on the opposite regimen. So they spent a month living in the lab so their diets and sleep could be totally controlled and monitored. Just looking at the scales, sleep duration didn’t seem to matter, during both periods they ate the same number of calories and lost the same amount of weight, but most of the weight lost while getting 8.5 hours was fat, whereas most of the weight lost when only getting 5.5 hours of sleep a night was lean body mass. Same diet, but with more sleep they ended up losing more than twice as much body fat. So you snooze you lose… fat! In our next story, we discover how getting just one more hour of sleep a night may help with weight control. I featured a study that found that curtailing sleep can cut your rate of body fat loss in half, while exacerbating the loss of lean mass. To get better insight into what was going on, researchers took fat and muscle biopsies from people after a night of sleep loss. In terms of genes that were turned on and off, molecular signatures were discovered suggesting muscle breakdown and fat buildup. That was after an all-nighter, though, and in the weight-loss study the sleep-restricted groups ended up getting little more than 5 hours a night. What about a more realistic scenario like sleeping just like one hour less a night? Overweight adults were randomized to 8 weeks of a calorie restricted diet or the same diet combined with just 5 days a week of one hour a night less sleep. The sleep restricted group achieved the one hour a day less sleep on weekdays but ended up sleeping an hour more on the weekend days. So overall, they just cut about 3 hours of sleep out of their week. Would just those few hours a week make any weight loss difference? On the scale, no, but in the normal sleep group, 80% of the weight loss was fat, whereas in the group just missing a few hours of sleep a week it was the opposite— 80% of the loss was lean. This shows that a few hours of “catch up sleep” on the weekends is insufficient, and may in fact be contributing to the problem based on “social jetlag” effect I explored in a previous video. A comparable study was designed for kids, but the sleeping periods only lasted a week. Eight- to eleven-year olds were randomized to either increase or decrease their time in bed by 1.5 hours per night for a week and then switch the following week. They ate an average of 134 calories more on the days they slept less and gained in that week about half a pound compared to the sleep-more week. The question then becomes would sleeping more facilitate weight loss? When it comes to body fat, can we just, sleep it off? The benefit of interventional studies is that you can demonstrate cause and effect, but observational studies can allow you to more easily track people and their behaviors over a longer time span. For example, researchers followed a group of mostly overweight individuals who started out to averaging less than six hours of sleep a night for more than five years. During that time, about half maintained that schedule but the other half increased their sleep duration up to seven or eight hours a night and ended up gaining 5 pounds less fat. A study entitled “Sleeping habits predict the magnitude of fat loss” (among those cutting calories) found that every extra hour of sleep at night was associated with an extra 1-and-a-half pounds of weight loss over a period of about 3 to 6 months. That’s not the same as randomizing people to extra sleep, though. Maybe they were sleeping more because they were exercising more and that’s the real reason they lost more weight? Getting people to bump their sleep from about 5.5 hours up to 7 can lead to an overall decrease in appetite within two weeks, particularly for sugary and salty foods. A four-week study getting habitually short sleepers to sleep about an extra hour a night led them to consume about two fewer spoonful’s worth of sugar a day compared to the control group but this didn’t translate into any changes in body composition. A twelve-week study, on the other hand, randomizing overweight and obese individuals to a weight loss intervention with or without a sleep component found that the sleep group lost weight significantly faster. A national cross-sectional survey suggested lower obesity rates among kids in households that regularly ate dinner together as a family, got adequate sleep, and limited screen times, and so Harvard researchers decided to try to... put those behaviors to the test. A six-month randomized trial to improve household routines for obesity prevention among young children resulted in a lower BMI. Normally it’s hard to tease out the effects of multi-component interventions, but in this case exhortations to limit overall TV watching didn’t work, and the families were already eating together 6 days a week and so that didn’t change much either. The only thing they were able to get the kids to significantly alter was their sleep, and so the improved weight outcomes may be attributed at least in part to the ¾ hour average increase in nightly sleep. Overall, most sleep improvement interventions tended to show improved weight loss. I was intrigued to look up the one study that didn’t. The nice thing about systematic reviews (as opposed to so-called “narrative” reviews) is that they exhaustively include mention of every study that meets some prespecified criteria. This keeps reviewers from cherry-picking, but it can also lead to the inclusion of some strange studies. In this case, a randomized controlled trial of didgeridoo playing, the indigenous Australian wind instrument. Those randomized to the didgeridoo to improve their sleep quality did not lose any weight, but they also failed to improve the quality of their sleep (or, likely, that of their neighbors). Did you know that lactucin, the hypnotic component of lettuce, is a natural dietary remedy for insomnia? Here’s the story. There is a perception that time spent asleep is time wasted, but it is widely recognized that inadequate sleep is associated with multiple acute and chronic conditions, and results in the increased risk of death and disease.

But researchers at MIT dispelled those myths about a decade ago. Tryptophan is one amino acid among many found in proteins, and they all compete with one another for transport across the blood-brain barrier, into the brain. And, since tryptophan is present in most animal proteins in relatively small quantities, it gets muscled out of the way. If you eat plant foods, though, the carbohydrates cause a release of insulin, which causes your muscles to take up the non-tryptophan amino acids as fuel. And so, your tryptophan can be first in line for brain access. Animal foods can even make things worse: “When tryptophan is ingested as part of a protein meal, serum tryptophan levels rise, but brain tryptophan levels decline… due to the mechanism of transport used by tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier.” The tryptophan levels in those given a high-protein turkey, egg, cheese breakfast dropped, whereas in the waffle-OJ group, their tryptophan levels went up. This may actually explain the carbohydrate cravings one sees in PMS— your brain may be trying to get you to boost tryptophan levels to feel better. “Consumption of a carbohydrate-rich, protein-poor evening test meal during the premenstrual period improved depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, fatigue, alertness, and calmness scores [significantly] among patients with premenstrual syndrome.” “Because synthesis of brain serotonin, which is known to be involved in mood and appetite, increases after carbohydrate intake, premenstrual syndrome subjects may overconsume carbohydrates in an attempt to improve their dysphoric mood state.” Ideally, though, it would be more than just carbs— we’ll cover the ideal mixture in tomorrow’s video-of-the-day.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Sleep and weight loss: Even getting just one more hour of sleep a night may help with weight control.\n\nThis video was based on the sleep section in my book, How Not to Diet, which you can learn more about here (https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-diet/) (all proceeds go to charity), or check out my presentation based on the book: Evidence-Based Weight Loss (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-weight-loss-live-presentation/).\n\nIf you missed the previous video, see Does Lack of Sleep Cause You to Gain Weight?

This may help explain why studies show that those eating plant-based diets have superior mood states. This is the final video of a four-part series (mentioned in Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death [http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/]) on natural ways to boost serotonin in the brain.

The findings of better mood scores in those eating vegetarian is consistent with both cross-sectional (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/) and interventional (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-mood-through-diet/) findings I've reported previously. The reason I report more data on nuts than seeds is due to researchers' greater access to funding for studies involving nuts (thanks to producer groups). From what little data we have, though, I have a feeling it's like the soy versus other beans story (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-worth-a-hill-of-beans/). If I had to guess, I'd bet that, in general, seeds may be even healthier than nuts, and since I encourage daily nut consumption, I'd add seeds to that recommendation as well.

Since the main determinant of brain serotonin concentrations appears to be the ratio of tryptophan with others that compete with it for uptake into the brain, to maximize the mood- elevating effects of diet, one would ideally choose a snack with a high tryptophan-to-total protein ratio— which would mean primarily seeds, such as sesame, sunflower, pumpkin. “Protein-source tryptophan as an efficacious treatment for social anxiety disorder: a pilot study.” So, what protein source did they use? Butternut squash seeds, because of their high tryptophan-to-protein ratio, as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of people suffering from social phobia, also known as social anxiety disorder. And, they found significant improvement in multiple objective measures of anxiety in those eating the squash seed bars. Before studies like this one, “a change in the composition of intact dietary protein was not seen as a possible option for the treatment of common psychological disorders associated with low serotonin levels.” But, that’s because they were Using animal proteins (which can make things worse), not plants. If this is true, then those eating vegetarian should be golden. And, indeed, this was the reasoning used to explain why “Global mood… was significantly better in the ‘vegetarian’ than in the ‘mixed’ diet group.” It’s all about carbohydrates, and a huge tryptophan-to-protein ratio. “The vegetarian group was instructed to avoid meat, fish, and poultry and to restrict intake of milk, milk products and eggs to a minimum…” And, within three weeks, the vegetarian diet groups had a significantly improved global mood.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Did you know you can gain weight if you don’t get enough sleep?

The most dire effect may be endothelial dysfunction. The endothelium is the thin layer of cells that covers the internal surface of blood vessels and is responsible for allowing our arteries to relax and dilate back open properly. Randomize people for about a week to get five rather than seven hours of sleep, and just that two-hour difference a night resulted in a significant impairment in artery function. Okay, but what do these numbers mean? How bad is a week of 5-hour nights? Sleep deprivation is no joke. The magnitude of impairment is similar to that reported in people who smoke, have diabetes, or have coronary artery disease. No wonder people who sleep less than seven hours a night may experience a 12% to 35% increased risk of premature death compared to those who get a full seven hours. Yet a significant proportion of the population may routinely get less than that. Sufficiently long, restful sleep sessions each night are said to be an indisputable cornerstone of good health. Okay, so what can we do about it? Those who have sleep apnea, a common consequence of obesity that interferes with sleep, benefit from the use of CPAP machines while they\'re losing the weight to treat the underlying cause, hopefully. But what if apnea isn\'t your problem? What if you just have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep? In my book How Not to Diet, I have a whole section on sleep enhancement, where I go through the Four Rules of Sleep Conditioning and the Four Rules of Sleep Hygiene. What if you follow those guidelines but still can\'t get to sleep? Any natural dietary remedies? I already have videos on using kiwifruit to fight insomnia, and tart cherries, too. Are there any vegetables that might help? Lactuca sativa is a plant that has been traditionally used in the treatment of insomnia. What is this exotic sounding leafy vegetable? Lettuce! Evidently lettuce extracts have been used from the time of the Roman Empire as agents with sedative and sleep-inducing properties. Lettuce actually does have a hypnotic substance in it called lactucin, which is what makes lettuce taste a little bitter. But you don\'t know if it actually works until you put it to the test. And it works...in toads. But it also works in rodents. Sleep in both mice and rats is enhanced by romaine lettuce. They used romaine since it has a higher lactucin content compared to other lettuces. Okay, but does it work in people? About 10 years ago, a study was published in which insomnia sufferers were randomized to receive lettuce seed oil, oil extracted from lettuce seeds. Within a week, about 70% of those in the lettuce seed oil group said their insomnia very much or much improved, compared to only 20% in the placebo control group. The researchers concluded that lettuce seed oil was found to be a useful, safe sleeping aid in geriatric patients suffering from sleeping difficulties. They chose to study older individuals because insomnia affects surprisingly 20 to 40% of older adults at least a few nights a month. You think that\'s bad. Sleep disturbances can plague as many as nearly 8 out of 10 women during pregnancy. Of course, there\'s lots of different sleeping pills, but they may endanger the fetus or mother. For example, doctors frequently prescribe Ambien for pregnant women who have trouble sleeping, but Ambien use is associated with a wide range of adverse pregnancy outcomes like low birth weight babies, premature birth, and cesarean section. And the use of valium during pregnancy has been linked to birth defects including limb deficiencies. There has to be a better way. What about trying lettuce? The lettuce oil study had a number of limitations. For example, it was only single-blind, meaning the researchers knew who was on the lettuce supplements and who was on placebo, which could have introduced some bias. But the researchers essentially said, ""Give us a break. Big pharma has billions to spend on research. No one wants to fund studies on lettuce."" Finally, we got a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, but this time on a whole food, not just a lettuce seed extract. Yeah, but how do you come up with a placebo lettuce? How are you going to hide who gets lettuce and who doesn\'t? Well, you can\'t fit a head of lettuce into a capsule, but you can fit whole lettuce seeds. And here we go: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial on lettuce seeds for pregnancy-related insomnia. A hundred pregnant women with insomnia were randomized to receive capsules containing either a quarter teaspoon of ground lettuce seeds or a placebo for two weeks, and those on the lettuce seeds saw a significant improvement in a sleep quality index score compared to placebo with no reported side effects.

We saw from the kiwifruit study  that this seemed possible,  but the mechanism they  suggested for the effect— the serotonin levels in kiwifruit,  doesn\'t make any sense,  since serotonin can\'t cross  the blood-brain barrier.  So you can eat all  the serotonin you want  and it shouldn\'t affect  your brain chemistry. A different brain chemical,  though, melatonin,  can get from our  gut to our brain. Melatonin is a hormone  secreted at night  to help regulate our  circadian rhythms  by the pineal gland in  the center of our brain.  Supplements of the stuff are used  to prevent and reduce jet lag and about 20 years ago  MIT got the patent  to use melatonin to  help people sleep.  Melatonin is not only produced  in the pineal gland, though,  but also is naturally  present in edible plants. That might explain the  results of this study,  the Effects of a Tart Cherry Juice Beverage  on the Sleep of Older Adults with Insomnia. The research group had been  doing an earlier study  on tart cherry juice  as a sports recovery drink.  See, there\'s a  phytonutrient in cherries  with anti-inflammatory effects  on par with drugs like  aspirin, ibuprofen,  so they were trying to  see if they could help  reduce muscle soreness  after exercise  and some of the participants  in the study  just anecdotally said that they were sleeping better  on the cherries. That was unexpected.  But the researchers  realized that  cherries are a plant food  source of melatonin,  so they put it  to the test.  The reason they chose  older subjects is that  melatonin production tends  to drop as we age,  which may be  one reason why  there\'s higher insomnia  rates in the elderly.  So, they took a group of  older men and women suffering from  chronic insomnia  and put half on cherries  and half on placebo.  Now they couldn\'t use whole  cherries for the study,  because how could  you fool people with a fake placebo cherry?  So they used cherry juice  versus ""cherry Koolaid,""  and found significant but  modest improvements in sleep,  so for example fell to  sleep a few minutes faster,  and had 17 fewer minutes of  waking after sleep onset,  meaning, waking up in  the middle of the night.  So it was no  insomnia cure,  but it helped without  side effects. How do we know it was  the melatonin, though?  They repeated the study,  this time measuring  the melatonin levels  and indeed saw a boost in  circulating melatonin levels after the cherry juice,  but not after the koolaid. Similar results were found  in people eating  the actual cherries— 7 different varieties,  boosting melatonin levels  and actual sleep times.  The effects of all the other  phytonutrients in cherries  can\'t be precluded,  maybe they helped too, but if it is the melatonin,  there are more potent  sources than cherries. Orange bell peppers  have a bit,  an ounce of walnuts.  A tablespoon  of flaxseeds  has about as much  as a tomato,  all less than the tart  cherries that were tested,  but people may eat a lot more  tomatoes than cherries,  especially tart cherries.  Sweet cherries have 50 times  less melatonin than tart  and dried cherries  appear to have none.  In fact, the melatonin  content of tomatoes  was suggested as  one of the reasons traditional Mediterranean  diets were so healthy.  A few spices are  pretty potent,  just a teaspoon of fenugreek  seeds or mustard seeds  has about as much  as a few tomatoes, but the bronze, silver,  and gold go to  almonds, raspberries, and  goji berries off the charts. Now even gojis just have  15 micrograms an ounce,  but melatonin is potent stuff.  You inject just  10 into people  and you can boost their blood  levels 50 fold in 5 minutes.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

After literally hundreds of  studies we still don\'t know  the best answer to  either question. A few years ago I featured a large  hundred thousand-person study suggesting that ""Both short  and long sleep duration""  ""were associated with  increased mortality""  with people getting around  7 hours of sleep living longest. Since then a meta-analysis  of all such studies  including more than a  million people was published,  and they found  the same thing.  We still don\'t know, though,  if sleep duration is a cause,  or simply a marker  of ill health. Maybe sleeping too  little or too long  does make you unhealthy, or maybe we see the associated  lifespan shortening  because being unhealthy causes you  to sleep shorter or longer. Similar work has now been published  on cognitive function.  After controlling for  a long list of factors,  men and women in their 50s  and 60s getting 7 or 8 hours  appeared to have the  best short-term memory,  compared to those that  got much more or much less.  Same thing was just demonstrated  with immune function:  ""both reduced and prolonged  habitual sleep durations""  ""were associated with an  increased risk of pneumonia"". It\'s easy to prevent over  sleeping-- set an alarm.  But what if your problem  is not getting enough?  What if you\'re the 1 in  3 adults that suffers  symptoms of insomnia?  Sure there are drugs like  valium you can take for insomnia in  the short term, but they have a number  of adverse side effects  and non-pharmacological approaches such as cognitive behavioral  therapy are often difficult,  time-consuming, and  don\'t always work.  Wouldn\'t it be great to  have ""natural treatments  ""that can improve both sleep  onset and help patients""  ""improve the quality of  sleep while improving""  ""next-day symptoms  over the long term""?  The ""Effect of kiwifruit consumption on  sleep quality in adults with sleep problems.""  Two kiwi fruit an hour before  bed every night for four weeks.  Why study kiwifruits?  Well, people with sleep  disorders tend to have high levels of oxidative stress  so maybe antioxidant  rich foods may help,  but all fruits and vegetables  have antioxidants.  Ah, but kiwifruits contain twice  the serotonin of tomatoes,  but it really shouldn\'t cross  the blood/brain barrier.  Kiwifruit has folate,  and a deficiency might cause insomnia,  but there\'s lots more folate  in some other plant foods.  The reason they studied  kiwifruits is because they got grant money  from a kiwifruit company,  and I\'m glad they did  because they found  some really remarkable results:  significantly improved sleep onset,  duration, and efficiency  using both subjective and  objective measurements.  Went from sleeping  6 hours a night to 7,  just eating a few kiwifruit.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'There may be a way to get the benefits of over-the-counter melatonin supplements without the risk.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

For these reasons,  melatonin supplements cannot be recommended. Too bad there’s no way you can get the benefits without the risks— unless, melatonin was  somehow found naturally in certain foods you could eat. Melatonin was first discovered in plants in 1995 and has since been found throughout the plant kingdom. But, enough that eating them actually affects your levels? Yes. You randomize people to eat more or fewer vegetables, and you can see the effect. Hard to get people to  eat vegetables though. How about beer? The melatonin present in beer contributes to an increase in the levels of melatonin in the human bloodstream. Though, alcohol consumption  may actually mess with your own endogenous melatonin secretion; so, beer probably isn’t the best choice. Eat two bananas, or drink the juice of about 2 pounds of  oranges or pineapple, and you can get significant bumps in melatonin concentrations in your blood, and the melatonin levels found in those fruits are pretty modest, compared to some other foods. Here’s the breakdown. The single food within each category with the highest recorded melatonin level, and how much you’d have to eat at one time to reach a physiological dose in your bloodstream. We make melatonin; so, it should come as no surprise that other animals do too. The most melatonin-rich meat tested was salmon, but because there were only billionths of a gram per serving, you’d have to sit down and eat about 200 pounds to get the effect. OK. So, forget meat. What about whole grains? The highest recorded was a strain of corn so rich in melatonin you’d only have to eat 16 ears of corn. All right, scratch that. What about other vegetables? Plain white button mushrooms  top the list. Only two pounds. A hundred times more  melatonin than meat, but still, they’re so light, 2 pounds is like eating 10 cups of mushrooms. That’s a lot in one sitting. Thankfully, cranberries to the rescue, the most melatonin-rich fruit. Just a single ounce, and it’s like you just took a melatonin supplement, with only good side effects, other than, of course, the extreme sourness. That’s about a third of a cup of cranberries. They’re pretty sturdy; so, you could travel without them getting smooshed, but what do you do with them once you get there. Easy to blend into a smoothie, but what if you’re stuck in a hotel? Can you eat dried cranberries, like what are they called—craisins? A study of various tart cherry products suggests that the drying process wipes out the melatonin; so, no melatonin in dried cherries and presumably dried cranberries either, nor in juice. The level of melatonin in cherry juice concentrate was almost nondetectable; so, drinking cranberry juice would also presumably be a wash, which brings us to nuts. Pistachios are not just the most melatonin-rich nut, they are simply off-the-charts as the most melatonin-rich food ever recorded. To get a physiological dose of melatonin, all you have to eat is two. Two what? Just two pistachios. Check it out; here are the data. More than 200 micrograms of melatonin per gram, point two milligrams per gram. And, you can get the normal daily spike your brain gives you by taking just 0.3 micrograms: so, just two nuts. So, taking a whole handful of pistachio nuts is like taking one of those high dose melatonin supplements. So, the best food for jet lag appears to be appropriately  timed pistachios.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Taking less than just 18 Ambien-class sleeping pills in an entire year may triple the risk of dying prematurely.\n\nIs Six Hours of Sleep Enough?

Even if that was all due to the difference in sleep, that\'s still only 6 pounds for 10,000+ more hours of sleep. If even a tiny fraction of that time was spent on diet and exercise, you know, biking to the nearest farm stand, more weight could have been lost in 16 weeks than in those 16 years. Every little bit helps, though, and getting at least seven hours is healthier for you anyway. This biggest reason to lose sleep over losing sleep is motor vehicle accident risk. Driving drowsy increases your risk of killing yourself and others. People might think twice about getting behind the wheel after staying awake for 48 hours straight, but even just two weeks of sleeping 6 hours a night impairs your cognitive performance as much as pulling two all-nighters in a row. So, what\'s the best way to sleep better? Sleeping pills are a nonstarter. Those prescribed even less than 18 pills a year of so-called hypnotics, the class of sleeping pills that includes Ambien, appear to have triple the risk of dying prematurely. Since up to 10% of the adult population is prescribed these drugs, if the drugs really are killing people, that could mean a six-figure death toll every year. Ambien\'s manufacturer questioned the study, but that\'s just one of dozens of studies that found a significant association between sleeping pills and premature death. When the principal investigator at the Scripps Clinic Sleep Center was criticized for reporting alarmingly high death risks from these commonly used medications, he replied: ""We can\'t hide risks, even if they might frighten patients out of taking hypnotics. Patients have a right to know."" What\'s more, non-pharmacological methods have been found to work as good or better than the drugs. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is what\'s called ""cognitive behavioral therapy, "" which combines conditioning techniques to re-associate the bed with sleep and education surrounding optimal sleep hygiene. Here are the four rules of sleep conditioning. (1) Go to bed only when you\'re sleepy. (2) Only use the bed for sleep (and sex). No reading, eating, or screen time. (3) If you can\'t fall asleep within about 15-20 minutes, get up, leave the bedroom, and don\'t come back until you\'re sleepy again. And repeat as necessary. And finally (4), get up at the same time every morning, no matter how little sleep you get. And although avoiding napping is often added, contrary to expectations, the majority of research does not show that daytime naps interfere with nighttime sleep. If there were four rules of sleep hygiene I\'d pick out, it would be (1): exercise regularly. The best time to exercise to improve sleep appears to be 4 to 8 hours before bedtime, though it appears to be a myth that exercising right before bed is somehow disruptive to sleep. (2) Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bedtime. We used to think as long as you don\'t drink caffeine in the evening, it wouldn\'t affect sleep, but four cups of coffee worth even six hours before bedtime can reduce total sleep time by more than an hour. Even just two cups in the morning at 7 a.m. can change what your brainwaves look like on EEG that night, though it\'s not clear if this has any clinical relevance beyond delaying the onset of sleep by an average of 10 minutes. Late afternoon alcohol consumption (6 hours before bedtime) may also impair sleep, even after it\'s cleared out of your system. And nicotine, whether from gum, pill, patch, or cigarette, can also have negative sleep effects, though so too can active nicotine withdrawal. Food-wise, low fiber intakes and high saturated fat and sugar intake is associated with lighter, less restorative sleep. Meat intake is associated with napping, suggested as a proxy for sleepiness. This may be one of the reasons insomnia has been reported as a side-effect of low carb, ketogenic diets. Supplement-wise, a single megadose of vitamin D was found to improve sleep duration and quality in men and women ages 20 through 50 with sleeping disorders. And I\'ve already talked about melatonin-rich foods and supplements in previous videos. (3) Make the bedroom quiet, dark, cool, and comfortable. Nocturnal noise can adversely impact sleep even if we\'re not consciously aware of it. Within a few days, you can become habituated to noises such that they don\'t wake you up, but EEG studies and subjective sleep surveys show the quality of your sleep can still be affected. Thankfully, ear plugs and sound masking, like white noise machines, have been shown to help. And finally (4), establish a relaxing bedtime routine. Relaxation techniques such as massage, mindfulness meditation, and soothing music may also help. So may taking a relaxing hot bath or shower. One of the reasons late-night eating can delay sleep is that it may interfere with the drop in core body temperature that normally occurs about bedtime. That\'s thought to be one of the cues that it\'s time for bed. So, should you not take a hot bath before bed? No, because as soon as you step out of the bath or shower, the rapid decline in skin temperature can accentuate the natural nighttime drop and improve sleep. Even just a warm foot bath may help you fall asleep about 15 minutes faster.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Foods for insomnia.

Force people to go one week with only six hours of sleep a night, and you can change expression of more than 700 genes. The most dire effect may be endothelial dysfunction. The endothelium is the thin layer of cells that covers the internal surface of blood vessels and is responsible for allowing our arteries to relax and dilate back open properly. Randomize people for about a week to get five rather than seven hours of sleep, and just that two-hour difference a night resulted in a significant impairment in artery function. Okay, but what do these numbers mean? How bad is a week of 5-hour nights? Sleep deprivation is no joke. The magnitude of impairment is similar to that reported in people who smoke, have diabetes, or have coronary artery disease. No wonder people who sleep less than seven hours a night may experience a 12% to 35% increased risk of premature death compared to those who get a full seven hours. Yet a significant proportion of the population may routinely get less than that. Sufficiently long, restful sleep sessions each night are said to be an indisputable cornerstone of good health. Okay, so what can we do about it? Those who have sleep apnea, a common consequence of obesity that interferes with sleep, benefit from the use of CPAP machines while they\'re losing the weight to treat the underlying cause, hopefully. But what if apnea isn\'t your problem? What if you just have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep? In my book How Not to Diet, I have a whole section on sleep enhancement, where I go through the Four Rules of Sleep Conditioning and the Four Rules of Sleep Hygiene. What if you follow those guidelines but still can\'t get to sleep? Any natural dietary remedies? I already have videos on using kiwifruit to fight insomnia, and tart cherries, too. Are there any vegetables that might help? Lactuca sativa is a plant that has been traditionally used in the treatment of insomnia. What is this exotic sounding leafy vegetable? Lettuce! Evidently lettuce extracts have been used from the time of the Roman Empire as agents with sedative and sleep-inducing properties. Lettuce actually does have a hypnotic substance in it called lactucin, which is what makes lettuce taste a little bitter. But you don\'t know if it actually works until you put it to the test. And it works...in toads. But it also works in rodents. Sleep in both mice and rats is enhanced by romaine lettuce. They used romaine since it has a higher lactucin content compared to other lettuces. Okay, but does it work in people? About 10 years ago, a study was published in which insomnia sufferers were randomized to receive lettuce seed oil, oil extracted from lettuce seeds. Within a week, about 70% of those in the lettuce seed oil group said their insomnia very much or much improved, compared to only 20% in the placebo control group. The researchers concluded that lettuce seed oil was found to be a useful, safe sleeping aid in geriatric patients suffering from sleeping difficulties. They chose to study older individuals because insomnia affects surprisingly 20 to 40% of older adults at least a few nights a month. You think that\'s bad. Sleep disturbances can plague as many as nearly 8 out of 10 women during pregnancy. Of course, there\'s lots of different sleeping pills, but they may endanger the fetus or mother. For example, doctors frequently prescribe Ambien for pregnant women who have trouble sleeping, but Ambien use is associated with a wide range of adverse pregnancy outcomes like low birth weight babies, premature birth, and cesarean section. And the use of valium during pregnancy has been linked to birth defects including limb deficiencies. There has to be a better way. What about trying lettuce? The lettuce oil study had a number of limitations. For example, it was only single-blind, meaning the researchers knew who was on the lettuce supplements and who was on placebo, which could have introduced some bias. But the researchers essentially said, ""Give us a break. Big pharma has billions to spend on research. No one wants to fund studies on lettuce."" Finally, we got a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, but this time on a whole food, not just a lettuce seed extract. Yeah, but how do you come up with a placebo lettuce? How are you going to hide who  gets lettuce and who doesn\'t? Well, you can\'t fit a head of lettuce into a capsule, but you can fit whole lettuce seeds. And here we go: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial on lettuce seeds for pregnancy-related insomnia. A hundred pregnant women with insomnia were randomized to receive capsules containing either a quarter teaspoon of ground lettuce seeds or a placebo for two weeks, and those on the lettuce seeds saw a significant improvement in a sleep quality index score compared to placebo with no reported side effects.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Randomized controlled studies put nuts, berries, and grape juice to the test for cognitive function.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

They’re just talking about associations, meaning berry eaters and nut eaters tend to have better brain function as they age after trying to control for a bunch of other lifestyle factors, but you don’t know if it’s cause and effect... until you put it to the test. Thankfully, we now have a growing number of interventional studies that have done just that. Randomized controlled trials where people eat berries or nuts and you can prove it— actually show improvements in cognitive performance, raising the berry nutty idea that we may be able to forestall or reverse the effects of neurodegeneration in aging with food. For example, this study on the effects of walnut consumption on cognitive performance. College students split up into groups doing two months of walnuts followed by two months of placebo or vice versa and then they switch. How do you make a placebo nut? They baked it in. They gave people banana bread with or without nuts; same ingredients, just one with walnuts, and those on the nuts showed a significant improvement in “inference capacity,” the ability to accurately draw conclusions from a set of facts, in other words, critical thinking. And so, on a practical level, maybe students or young professionals in fields that involve a great deal of critical thinking or decision-making could possibly benefit and gain a slight advantage through regular consumption of walnuts. Or this berry study, where they randomized folks to some crazy berry smoothie with blueberries, black currants, elderberries, lingonberries, strawberries, and…  a tomato. And not only did their bad cholesterol drop about 10 points, they performed better on short-term memory tests; so, good for the heart, good for the brain. And not just better on like pencil-and-paper tests, but real-world applications. Give people concord grape juice versus some fake grape Kool-Aid-type placebo, and you get improved performance on everyday tasks—like quicker response times in driving tests. Why not just give people concord grapes instead of juice? Well, then, it’s harder to create a placebo and, of course, the study was paid for by Welch’s. OK, fruit and nuts, what about vegetables? Consumers of cruciferous vegetables, like cabbage, cauliflower, kale, collards, broccoli and Brussels sprouts, have been found to perform better in several cognitive tests than non-users. In terms of cognitive decline with aging, women consuming the most green leafies did better, effectively slowing brain aging a year or two, and not just cruciferous, but other dark green leafies like spinach; so, maybe it’s the nitrates. As we age, our cerebral blood flow drops, the amount of blood flowing through our brain, which may be due to an age-related decrease in the production of nitric oxide, the open sesame molecule that dilates our blood vessels and is boosted by the consumption of nitrate-rich vegetables. This reduction in blood flow to the brain may be a major risk factor for the impairment of cognitive function and development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia. We know nitrate-rich vegetables like leafy greens and beets can improve physiological performance, like beet juice does for athletes, but what about cognitive performance? We’ll find out…next.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Solis I didn't say that I only said if you have Crohn's disease and or hidradenitis suppurativa everybody else feel free to eat your nutrition yeast in fact it's a way to get your vitamin b12 if it's fortified with b12 oh speaking of b12 ApS is duckweed a safe plant source for b12 and the answer is not until it's proven to be right I mean that's critically important all right vitamin b12 so the company that makes it or that packaged it that sells it purports on to show active b12 that is improvement until people with b12 deficiency are a given duckweed is a sole source and their b12 level recovers right there home assistant comes down if they're fully replete or they're methylmalonic acid level drops it's the only way right um so there's a lot of tests for b12 that don't necessarily show active b12 there are b12 analogs cause your body can't use fools our body actually they're like connect as anti b12 so you just do not want to mess around you can end up paralyzed demented or dead from a b12 deficiency so until it's proven to be a reliable source where they actually do a clinical study you could it's easy to find vegans low in b12 right because so many vegans are too stupid to not to to not supplement they are stupid for not supplementing and um so you put pretend of them twenty of them and give them some duckweed and see what happens and until then it's not a reliable source of b12 until it's proven to be a reliable source of b12 because it's not something you want to mess around with all right critically important all right and look even if they claimed that there's a bacteria that kind of lives in the duckweed that produce would be 12 let's say they do the study and they show that a batch of duckweed improves their their veto status okay that's great so you can you say that that batch of duckweed improves to be 12 it doesn't mean all duckweed or all the duckweed they even sell has active b12 maybe it has different bacteria that aren't making b12 at the moment so unless they can show reliably that whatever species of duckweed they have just always makes b12 that's always usable by people if that's not the case then you need to stick with supplements a vitamin b12 or vitamin b12 fortified foods okay Emily Paige Peron or posh a Peron says hi what you take on gluten flour homemade note well no salt say 1000 obviously so not a whole food but it's a green yellow or green light food um so it's a yellow light food it's the process plant food so it's a platform from which something bad good has been taken away or something bad has been added and here's this case nothing bad has been added but there has been something good taken away right you you know how to make seitan you wash away the fiber wash away some nutrition but but in terms of meat substitutes certainly better then you know everything else in the market right which has added sodium often added saturated fat of course what would be even better meets us to real whole food like legumes whole grains mushrooms these kind of things okay anyway tattooed woman asked please talk about nano volley pig in assists and how hard it is for the Oh for the body it turned carbohydrate into fat so tattooed women did not mean men denovo leap in Genesis she meant that de novo epigenesis so your body so it's true that if you over feed people calories it's easier to make people gain weight giving people fat calories in carbohydrate calories in fact you can make 100,000 College disappear by effective feeding people trying to over feed people carbohydrates opposed to fat I talked about this study but in long Vermont prisoners where they tried this experimental weight gain say they tried to get people to gain weight took one hundred thousand more calories on a mixed diet then then all fat died but but the problem it so but if you like you drink all ones if you drink a couple liters of soda a day even though you won't make a lot of fat you know where that fat is made that fat is made in your liver increases liver fat which is can dull the sensitivity to insulin in your liver and set you up for all sorts of badness so so yeah do not overeat my added sugars so yeah okay so even if it doesn't you're like oh it just puts a few grams of fat on your body huh yeah because where it is liver fat that's a bad thing increase your risk of fat liver disease again bad thing okay the chosen comment asks someone working in hospitals working for on for office it possible is it difficult to it is difficult to intermittent task I'm not eating the middle of night any recommendations I don't eat the middle of the night I mean that's there's not much you can do I mean there's all sorts of clonal biological badness that comes along with night shifts I'm like the light in the middle of the night that's not good but you can't do much about that but you can do something about eating so you don't eat it you still don't either die on you eat before you go to before you go to bed and in the morning or before you go to - - to work and in terms of well I'm gonna get so hungry going on that without food well you need to you know eat your thylakoids you

Carbohydrates, on the other hand, can boost transport across the blood-brain barrier, which has been used to explain premenstrual cravings. This is the third of a four-part series (mentioned in Uprooting the Leading Causes of Death (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/uprooting-the-leading-causes-of-death/)) on natural ways to boost serotonin in the brain. Wednesday's video-of-the-day Human Neurotransmitters in Plants (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/human-neurotransmitters-in-plants/) noted that plants themselves can contain serotonin. Yesterday's video The Wrong Way to Boost Serotonin (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-wrong-way-to-boost-serotonin/) was a cautionary tale about tryptophan supplements, and Monday we'll close with The Best Way to Boost Serotonin (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-best-way-to-boost-serotonin/). The arachidonic acid in animal foods may also contribute to negative mood states through an inflammatory mechanism.

But researchers at MIT dispelled those myths about a decade ago. Tryptophan is one amino acid among many found in proteins, and they all compete with one another for transport across the blood-brain barrier, into the brain. And, since tryptophan is present in most animal proteins in relatively small quantities, it gets muscled out of the way. If you eat plant foods, though, the carbohydrates cause a release of insulin, which causes your muscles to take up the non-tryptophan amino acids as fuel. And so, your tryptophan can be first in line for brain access. Animal foods can even make things worse: “When tryptophan is ingested as part of a protein meal, serum tryptophan levels rise, but brain tryptophan levels decline… due to the mechanism of transport used by tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier.” The tryptophan levels in those given a high-protein turkey, egg, cheese breakfast dropped, whereas in the waffle-OJ group, their tryptophan levels went up. This may actually explain the carbohydrate cravings one sees in PMS— your brain may be trying to get you to boost tryptophan levels to feel better. “Consumption of a carbohydrate-rich, protein-poor evening test meal during the premenstrual period improved depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, fatigue, alertness, and calmness scores [significantly] among patients with premenstrual syndrome.” “Because synthesis of brain serotonin, which is known to be involved in mood and appetite, increases after carbohydrate intake, premenstrual syndrome subjects may overconsume carbohydrates in an attempt to improve their dysphoric mood state.” Ideally, though, it would be more than just carbs— we’ll cover the ideal mixture in tomorrow’s video-of-the-day.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Did you know you can gain weight if you don’t get enough sleep?

Maybe high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. Well, there’s nothing I like better than bringing you the information that will help you do just that. Welcome to the Nutrition Facts Podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Michael Greger. Today, we discover the health benefits of sleep. And we start with the connection between the lack of sleep and weight gain. Population studies have found short sleep duration has been associated with obesity in both children and adults. Observational studies can never prove cause-and-effect, though. Maybe the obesity is leading to sleep loss instead of the other way around. Obesity can cause arthritis, acid reflux, and apnea, all of which can interfere with sleep. The relationship between obesity and sleep apnea, where your breathing repeatedly stops and starts throughout the night, may be explained by increased tongue fat—fat deposited inside the base of the tongue— that may contribute to obstructing your airway when you sleep on your back. The reverse causation explanation of the link between obesity and inadequate sleep is bolstered by the finding that weight loss interventions can improve daytime sleepiness. Potential confounding factors also abound. For example, people with lower socioeconomic status often work less desirable hours such as rotating or overnight shifts, or may live in noisier neighborhoods with poorer air quality, more crime. The link between inadequate sleep and obesity persists after controlling for these kinds of factors, but you can’t control for everything. You can’t know for sure if sleep deprivation leads to weight gain until you,...put it to the test. Have people pull an all-nighter and they get hungrier and choose larger portions. Randomize people to shave even just a few hours of sleep off every night and they start eating an average of 677 calories more a day compared to the normal sleep control group. Although individual responses vary widely, anywhere from eating 813 calories less per day to as many as 1,437 calories more, on average, studies found sleep deprivation led people to overeat by about 180 to 560 calories a day. Restrict people’s sleep and they also start craving unhealthier choices– more snacks, more foods that are fatty and sugary. Stick people in a brain scanner after staying awake all night, or after few nights of four-hour sleep, and their reward pathways light up brighter in response to high calorie foods. Sleep deprivation bumps the levels of the chief endocannabinoid in the body, the natural chemical we synthesize that binds to the same receptors as the active ingredient in marijuana. This may help explain the nighttime nibbling. On the calories outside of the equation, some short sleepers may take the extra time to exercise; others will be so sleepy they exercise less. The extra wakefulness may raise calorie expenditure up to about 100 calories a day, but if sleep-deprived individuals are overeating hundreds of calories, over time sleep deprivation may end up putting the “wide” in wide awake. With insufficient sleep inadvertently leading to such higher calorie intake, it’s no surprise that 4 out of 5 studies involving as few as 2–5 nights of sleep restriction found an increase in body weight. In other words, if you sleep less, you may gain more OK, but here’s where it gets crazy. Even if you control calorie intake, you still lose more fat when you get more sleep. Overweight subjects who normally got between 6.5 to 8.5 hours of sleep a night were randomized to two weeks of either 8.5 hours of sleep a night or 5.5 hours of sleep on the same calorie- controlled diet. Then the groups switched and spent another two weeks on the opposite regimen. So they spent a month living in the lab so their diets and sleep could be totally controlled and monitored. Just looking at the scales, sleep duration didn’t seem to matter, during both periods they ate the same number of calories and lost the same amount of weight, but most of the weight lost while getting 8.5 hours was fat, whereas most of the weight lost when only getting 5.5 hours of sleep a night was lean body mass. Same diet, but with more sleep they ended up losing more than twice as much body fat. So you snooze you lose… fat! In our next story, we discover how getting just one more hour of sleep a night may help with weight control. I featured a study that found that curtailing sleep can cut your rate of body fat loss in half, while exacerbating the loss of lean mass. To get better insight into what was going on, researchers took fat and muscle biopsies from people after a night of sleep loss. In terms of genes that were turned on and off, molecular signatures were discovered suggesting muscle breakdown and fat buildup. That was after an all-nighter, though, and in the weight-loss study the sleep-restricted groups ended up getting little more than 5 hours a night. What about a more realistic scenario like sleeping just like one hour less a night? Overweight adults were randomized to 8 weeks of a calorie restricted diet or the same diet combined with just 5 days a week of one hour a night less sleep. The sleep restricted group achieved the one hour a day less sleep on weekdays but ended up sleeping an hour more on the weekend days. So overall, they just cut about 3 hours of sleep out of their week. Would just those few hours a week make any weight loss difference? On the scale, no, but in the normal sleep group, 80% of the weight loss was fat, whereas in the group just missing a few hours of sleep a week it was the opposite— 80% of the loss was lean. This shows that a few hours of “catch up sleep” on the weekends is insufficient, and may in fact be contributing to the problem based on “social jetlag” effect I explored in a previous video. A comparable study was designed for kids, but the sleeping periods only lasted a week. Eight- to eleven-year olds were randomized to either increase or decrease their time in bed by 1.5 hours per night for a week and then switch the following week. They ate an average of 134 calories more on the days they slept less and gained in that week about half a pound compared to the sleep-more week. The question then becomes would sleeping more facilitate weight loss? When it comes to body fat, can we just, sleep it off? The benefit of interventional studies is that you can demonstrate cause and effect, but observational studies can allow you to more easily track people and their behaviors over a longer time span. For example, researchers followed a group of mostly overweight individuals who started out to averaging less than six hours of sleep a night for more than five years. During that time, about half maintained that schedule but the other half increased their sleep duration up to seven or eight hours a night and ended up gaining 5 pounds less fat. A study entitled “Sleeping habits predict the magnitude of fat loss” (among those cutting calories) found that every extra hour of sleep at night was associated with an extra 1-and-a-half pounds of weight loss over a period of about 3 to 6 months. That’s not the same as randomizing people to extra sleep, though. Maybe they were sleeping more because they were exercising more and that’s the real reason they lost more weight? Getting people to bump their sleep from about 5.5 hours up to 7 can lead to an overall decrease in appetite within two weeks, particularly for sugary and salty foods. A four-week study getting habitually short sleepers to sleep about an extra hour a night led them to consume about two fewer spoonful’s worth of sugar a day compared to the control group but this didn’t translate into any changes in body composition. A twelve-week study, on the other hand, randomizing overweight and obese individuals to a weight loss intervention with or without a sleep component found that the sleep group lost weight significantly faster. A national cross-sectional survey suggested lower obesity rates among kids in households that regularly ate dinner together as a family, got adequate sleep, and limited screen times, and so Harvard researchers decided to try to... put those behaviors to the test. A six-month randomized trial to improve household routines for obesity prevention among young children resulted in a lower BMI. Normally it’s hard to tease out the effects of multi-component interventions, but in this case exhortations to limit overall TV watching didn’t work, and the families were already eating together 6 days a week and so that didn’t change much either. The only thing they were able to get the kids to significantly alter was their sleep, and so the improved weight outcomes may be attributed at least in part to the ¾ hour average increase in nightly sleep. Overall, most sleep improvement interventions tended to show improved weight loss. I was intrigued to look up the one study that didn’t. The nice thing about systematic reviews (as opposed to so-called “narrative” reviews) is that they exhaustively include mention of every study that meets some prespecified criteria. This keeps reviewers from cherry-picking, but it can also lead to the inclusion of some strange studies. In this case, a randomized controlled trial of didgeridoo playing, the indigenous Australian wind instrument. Those randomized to the didgeridoo to improve their sleep quality did not lose any weight, but they also failed to improve the quality of their sleep (or, likely, that of their neighbors). Did you know that lactucin, the hypnotic component of lettuce, is a natural dietary remedy for insomnia? Here’s the story. There is a perception that time spent asleep is time wasted, but it is widely recognized that inadequate sleep is associated with multiple acute and chronic conditions, and results in the increased risk of death and disease.

The most dire effect may be endothelial dysfunction. The endothelium is the thin layer of cells that covers the internal surface of blood vessels and is responsible for allowing our arteries to relax and dilate back open properly. Randomize people for about a week to get five rather than seven hours of sleep, and just that two-hour difference a night resulted in a significant impairment in artery function. Okay, but what do these numbers mean? How bad is a week of 5-hour nights? Sleep deprivation is no joke. The magnitude of impairment is similar to that reported in people who smoke, have diabetes, or have coronary artery disease. No wonder people who sleep less than seven hours a night may experience a 12% to 35% increased risk of premature death compared to those who get a full seven hours. Yet a significant proportion of the population may routinely get less than that. Sufficiently long, restful sleep sessions each night are said to be an indisputable cornerstone of good health. Okay, so what can we do about it? Those who have sleep apnea, a common consequence of obesity that interferes with sleep, benefit from the use of CPAP machines while they\'re losing the weight to treat the underlying cause, hopefully. But what if apnea isn\'t your problem? What if you just have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep? In my book How Not to Diet, I have a whole section on sleep enhancement, where I go through the Four Rules of Sleep Conditioning and the Four Rules of Sleep Hygiene. What if you follow those guidelines but still can\'t get to sleep? Any natural dietary remedies? I already have videos on using kiwifruit to fight insomnia, and tart cherries, too. Are there any vegetables that might help? Lactuca sativa is a plant that has been traditionally used in the treatment of insomnia. What is this exotic sounding leafy vegetable? Lettuce! Evidently lettuce extracts have been used from the time of the Roman Empire as agents with sedative and sleep-inducing properties. Lettuce actually does have a hypnotic substance in it called lactucin, which is what makes lettuce taste a little bitter. But you don\'t know if it actually works until you put it to the test. And it works...in toads. But it also works in rodents. Sleep in both mice and rats is enhanced by romaine lettuce. They used romaine since it has a higher lactucin content compared to other lettuces. Okay, but does it work in people? About 10 years ago, a study was published in which insomnia sufferers were randomized to receive lettuce seed oil, oil extracted from lettuce seeds. Within a week, about 70% of those in the lettuce seed oil group said their insomnia very much or much improved, compared to only 20% in the placebo control group. The researchers concluded that lettuce seed oil was found to be a useful, safe sleeping aid in geriatric patients suffering from sleeping difficulties. They chose to study older individuals because insomnia affects surprisingly 20 to 40% of older adults at least a few nights a month. You think that\'s bad. Sleep disturbances can plague as many as nearly 8 out of 10 women during pregnancy. Of course, there\'s lots of different sleeping pills, but they may endanger the fetus or mother. For example, doctors frequently prescribe Ambien for pregnant women who have trouble sleeping, but Ambien use is associated with a wide range of adverse pregnancy outcomes like low birth weight babies, premature birth, and cesarean section. And the use of valium during pregnancy has been linked to birth defects including limb deficiencies. There has to be a better way. What about trying lettuce? The lettuce oil study had a number of limitations. For example, it was only single-blind, meaning the researchers knew who was on the lettuce supplements and who was on placebo, which could have introduced some bias. But the researchers essentially said, ""Give us a break. Big pharma has billions to spend on research. No one wants to fund studies on lettuce."" Finally, we got a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, but this time on a whole food, not just a lettuce seed extract. Yeah, but how do you come up with a placebo lettuce? How are you going to hide who gets lettuce and who doesn\'t? Well, you can\'t fit a head of lettuce into a capsule, but you can fit whole lettuce seeds. And here we go: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial on lettuce seeds for pregnancy-related insomnia. A hundred pregnant women with insomnia were randomized to receive capsules containing either a quarter teaspoon of ground lettuce seeds or a placebo for two weeks, and those on the lettuce seeds saw a significant improvement in a sleep quality index score compared to placebo with no reported side effects.

Based on Dr. Michael Greger's insights from NutritionFacts.org, here are some food recommendations:

1. **Tart Cherries or Tart Cherry Juice**: Tart cherries are rich in melatonin, which is known to improve sleep quality. Drinking tart cherry juice or consuming whole tart cherries can help increase melatonin levels in the body, aiding in better sleep.

2. **Kiwifruit**: Consuming kiwifruit before bed has been shown to improve both sleep quality and sleep duration. Kiwifruits are rich in antioxidants and serotonin, which may have a beneficial effect on sleep patterns.

3. **Nuts, especially Almonds and Walnuts**: These nuts are good sources of magnesium and melatonin, both of which help promote sleep. Almonds and walnuts can be a healthy snack to consume before bed to enhance sleep quality.

4. **Bananas**: Rich in potassium and magnesium, bananas can help relax muscles and nerves, while also providing serotonin and melatonin to aid sleep.

5. **Complex Carbohydrates**: Foods like oatmeal or whole grain bread can increase the availability of tryptophan in the brain, which is converted to serotonin and then melatonin, promoting sleep.

6. **Herbal Teas**: Non-caffeinated herbal teas such as chamomile, passionflower, or valerian root can be soothing and help reduce anxiety, making it easier to fall asleep.

It's also important to avoid large meals, spicy foods, caffeine, and heavy or rich foods within a couple of hours of bedtime as these can disrupt sleep. Keeping the pre-sleep meal light and including some of the sleep-promoting foods mentioned can help achieve a deep, restorative sleep before an important exam.","To achieve deep, restorative sleep, especially before a big exam, it's beneficial to focus on foods that can naturally enhance sleep quality.

We saw from the kiwifruit study  that this seemed possible,  but the mechanism they  suggested for the effect— the serotonin levels in kiwifruit,  doesn\'t make any sense,  since serotonin can\'t cross  the blood-brain barrier.  So you can eat all  the serotonin you want  and it shouldn\'t affect  your brain chemistry. A different brain chemical,  though, melatonin,  can get from our  gut to our brain. Melatonin is a hormone  secreted at night  to help regulate our  circadian rhythms  by the pineal gland in  the center of our brain.  Supplements of the stuff are used  to prevent and reduce jet lag and about 20 years ago  MIT got the patent  to use melatonin to  help people sleep.  Melatonin is not only produced  in the pineal gland, though,  but also is naturally  present in edible plants. That might explain the  results of this study,  the Effects of a Tart Cherry Juice Beverage  on the Sleep of Older Adults with Insomnia. The research group had been  doing an earlier study  on tart cherry juice  as a sports recovery drink.  See, there\'s a  phytonutrient in cherries  with anti-inflammatory effects  on par with drugs like  aspirin, ibuprofen,  so they were trying to  see if they could help  reduce muscle soreness  after exercise  and some of the participants  in the study  just anecdotally said that they were sleeping better  on the cherries. That was unexpected.  But the researchers  realized that  cherries are a plant food  source of melatonin,  so they put it  to the test.  The reason they chose  older subjects is that  melatonin production tends  to drop as we age,  which may be  one reason why  there\'s higher insomnia  rates in the elderly.  So, they took a group of  older men and women suffering from  chronic insomnia  and put half on cherries  and half on placebo.  Now they couldn\'t use whole  cherries for the study,  because how could  you fool people with a fake placebo cherry?  So they used cherry juice  versus ""cherry Koolaid,""  and found significant but  modest improvements in sleep,  so for example fell to  sleep a few minutes faster,  and had 17 fewer minutes of  waking after sleep onset,  meaning, waking up in  the middle of the night.  So it was no  insomnia cure,  but it helped without  side effects. How do we know it was  the melatonin, though?  They repeated the study,  this time measuring  the melatonin levels  and indeed saw a boost in  circulating melatonin levels after the cherry juice,  but not after the koolaid. Similar results were found  in people eating  the actual cherries— 7 different varieties,  boosting melatonin levels  and actual sleep times.  The effects of all the other  phytonutrients in cherries  can\'t be precluded,  maybe they helped too, but if it is the melatonin,  there are more potent  sources than cherries. Orange bell peppers  have a bit,  an ounce of walnuts.  A tablespoon  of flaxseeds  has about as much  as a tomato,  all less than the tart  cherries that were tested,  but people may eat a lot more  tomatoes than cherries,  especially tart cherries.  Sweet cherries have 50 times  less melatonin than tart  and dried cherries  appear to have none.  In fact, the melatonin  content of tomatoes  was suggested as  one of the reasons traditional Mediterranean  diets were so healthy.  A few spices are  pretty potent,  just a teaspoon of fenugreek  seeds or mustard seeds  has about as much  as a few tomatoes, but the bronze, silver,  and gold go to  almonds, raspberries, and  goji berries off the charts. Now even gojis just have  15 micrograms an ounce,  but melatonin is potent stuff.  You inject just  10 into people  and you can boost their blood  levels 50 fold in 5 minutes.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

After literally hundreds of  studies we still don\'t know  the best answer to  either question. A few years ago I featured a large  hundred thousand-person study suggesting that ""Both short  and long sleep duration""  ""were associated with  increased mortality""  with people getting around  7 hours of sleep living longest. Since then a meta-analysis  of all such studies  including more than a  million people was published,  and they found  the same thing.  We still don\'t know, though,  if sleep duration is a cause,  or simply a marker  of ill health. Maybe sleeping too  little or too long  does make you unhealthy, or maybe we see the associated  lifespan shortening  because being unhealthy causes you  to sleep shorter or longer. Similar work has now been published  on cognitive function.  After controlling for  a long list of factors,  men and women in their 50s  and 60s getting 7 or 8 hours  appeared to have the  best short-term memory,  compared to those that  got much more or much less.  Same thing was just demonstrated  with immune function:  ""both reduced and prolonged  habitual sleep durations""  ""were associated with an  increased risk of pneumonia"". It\'s easy to prevent over  sleeping-- set an alarm.  But what if your problem  is not getting enough?  What if you\'re the 1 in  3 adults that suffers  symptoms of insomnia?  Sure there are drugs like  valium you can take for insomnia in  the short term, but they have a number  of adverse side effects  and non-pharmacological approaches such as cognitive behavioral  therapy are often difficult,  time-consuming, and  don\'t always work.  Wouldn\'t it be great to  have ""natural treatments  ""that can improve both sleep  onset and help patients""  ""improve the quality of  sleep while improving""  ""next-day symptoms  over the long term""?  The ""Effect of kiwifruit consumption on  sleep quality in adults with sleep problems.""  Two kiwi fruit an hour before  bed every night for four weeks.  Why study kiwifruits?  Well, people with sleep  disorders tend to have high levels of oxidative stress  so maybe antioxidant  rich foods may help,  but all fruits and vegetables  have antioxidants.  Ah, but kiwifruits contain twice  the serotonin of tomatoes,  but it really shouldn\'t cross  the blood/brain barrier.  Kiwifruit has folate,  and a deficiency might cause insomnia,  but there\'s lots more folate  in some other plant foods.  The reason they studied  kiwifruits is because they got grant money  from a kiwifruit company,  and I\'m glad they did  because they found  some really remarkable results:  significantly improved sleep onset,  duration, and efficiency  using both subjective and  objective measurements.

For these reasons,  melatonin supplements cannot be recommended. Too bad there’s no way you can get the benefits without the risks— unless, melatonin was  somehow found naturally in certain foods you could eat. Melatonin was first discovered in plants in 1995 and has since been found throughout the plant kingdom. But, enough that eating them actually affects your levels? Yes. You randomize people to eat more or fewer vegetables, and you can see the effect. Hard to get people to  eat vegetables though. How about beer? The melatonin present in beer contributes to an increase in the levels of melatonin in the human bloodstream. Though, alcohol consumption  may actually mess with your own endogenous melatonin secretion; so, beer probably isn’t the best choice. Eat two bananas, or drink the juice of about 2 pounds of  oranges or pineapple, and you can get significant bumps in melatonin concentrations in your blood, and the melatonin levels found in those fruits are pretty modest, compared to some other foods. Here’s the breakdown. The single food within each category with the highest recorded melatonin level, and how much you’d have to eat at one time to reach a physiological dose in your bloodstream. We make melatonin; so, it should come as no surprise that other animals do too. The most melatonin-rich meat tested was salmon, but because there were only billionths of a gram per serving, you’d have to sit down and eat about 200 pounds to get the effect. OK. So, forget meat. What about whole grains? The highest recorded was a strain of corn so rich in melatonin you’d only have to eat 16 ears of corn. All right, scratch that. What about other vegetables? Plain white button mushrooms  top the list. Only two pounds. A hundred times more  melatonin than meat, but still, they’re so light, 2 pounds is like eating 10 cups of mushrooms. That’s a lot in one sitting. Thankfully, cranberries to the rescue, the most melatonin-rich fruit. Just a single ounce, and it’s like you just took a melatonin supplement, with only good side effects, other than, of course, the extreme sourness. That’s about a third of a cup of cranberries. They’re pretty sturdy; so, you could travel without them getting smooshed, but what do you do with them once you get there. Easy to blend into a smoothie, but what if you’re stuck in a hotel? Can you eat dried cranberries, like what are they called—craisins? A study of various tart cherry products suggests that the drying process wipes out the melatonin; so, no melatonin in dried cherries and presumably dried cranberries either, nor in juice. The level of melatonin in cherry juice concentrate was almost nondetectable; so, drinking cranberry juice would also presumably be a wash, which brings us to nuts. Pistachios are not just the most melatonin-rich nut, they are simply off-the-charts as the most melatonin-rich food ever recorded. To get a physiological dose of melatonin, all you have to eat is two. Two what? Just two pistachios. Check it out; here are the data. More than 200 micrograms of melatonin per gram, point two milligrams per gram. And, you can get the normal daily spike your brain gives you by taking just 0.3 micrograms: so, just two nuts. So, taking a whole handful of pistachio nuts is like taking one of those high dose melatonin supplements.

Even if that was all due to the difference in sleep, that\'s still only 6 pounds for 10,000+ more hours of sleep. If even a tiny fraction of that time was spent on diet and exercise, you know, biking to the nearest farm stand, more weight could have been lost in 16 weeks than in those 16 years. Every little bit helps, though, and getting at least seven hours is healthier for you anyway. This biggest reason to lose sleep over losing sleep is motor vehicle accident risk. Driving drowsy increases your risk of killing yourself and others. People might think twice about getting behind the wheel after staying awake for 48 hours straight, but even just two weeks of sleeping 6 hours a night impairs your cognitive performance as much as pulling two all-nighters in a row. So, what\'s the best way to sleep better? Sleeping pills are a nonstarter. Those prescribed even less than 18 pills a year of so-called hypnotics, the class of sleeping pills that includes Ambien, appear to have triple the risk of dying prematurely. Since up to 10% of the adult population is prescribed these drugs, if the drugs really are killing people, that could mean a six-figure death toll every year. Ambien\'s manufacturer questioned the study, but that\'s just one of dozens of studies that found a significant association between sleeping pills and premature death. When the principal investigator at the Scripps Clinic Sleep Center was criticized for reporting alarmingly high death risks from these commonly used medications, he replied: ""We can\'t hide risks, even if they might frighten patients out of taking hypnotics. Patients have a right to know."" What\'s more, non-pharmacological methods have been found to work as good or better than the drugs. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is what\'s called ""cognitive behavioral therapy, "" which combines conditioning techniques to re-associate the bed with sleep and education surrounding optimal sleep hygiene. Here are the four rules of sleep conditioning. (1) Go to bed only when you\'re sleepy. (2) Only use the bed for sleep (and sex). No reading, eating, or screen time. (3) If you can\'t fall asleep within about 15-20 minutes, get up, leave the bedroom, and don\'t come back until you\'re sleepy again. And repeat as necessary. And finally (4), get up at the same time every morning, no matter how little sleep you get. And although avoiding napping is often added, contrary to expectations, the majority of research does not show that daytime naps interfere with nighttime sleep. If there were four rules of sleep hygiene I\'d pick out, it would be (1): exercise regularly. The best time to exercise to improve sleep appears to be 4 to 8 hours before bedtime, though it appears to be a myth that exercising right before bed is somehow disruptive to sleep. (2) Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bedtime. We used to think as long as you don\'t drink caffeine in the evening, it wouldn\'t affect sleep, but four cups of coffee worth even six hours before bedtime can reduce total sleep time by more than an hour. Even just two cups in the morning at 7 a.m. can change what your brainwaves look like on EEG that night, though it\'s not clear if this has any clinical relevance beyond delaying the onset of sleep by an average of 10 minutes. Late afternoon alcohol consumption (6 hours before bedtime) may also impair sleep, even after it\'s cleared out of your system. And nicotine, whether from gum, pill, patch, or cigarette, can also have negative sleep effects, though so too can active nicotine withdrawal. Food-wise, low fiber intakes and high saturated fat and sugar intake is associated with lighter, less restorative sleep. Meat intake is associated with napping, suggested as a proxy for sleepiness. This may be one of the reasons insomnia has been reported as a side-effect of low carb, ketogenic diets. Supplement-wise, a single megadose of vitamin D was found to improve sleep duration and quality in men and women ages 20 through 50 with sleeping disorders. And I\'ve already talked about melatonin-rich foods and supplements in previous videos. (3) Make the bedroom quiet, dark, cool, and comfortable. Nocturnal noise can adversely impact sleep even if we\'re not consciously aware of it. Within a few days, you can become habituated to noises such that they don\'t wake you up, but EEG studies and subjective sleep surveys show the quality of your sleep can still be affected. Thankfully, ear plugs and sound masking, like white noise machines, have been shown to help. And finally (4), establish a relaxing bedtime routine. Relaxation techniques such as massage, mindfulness meditation, and soothing music may also help. So may taking a relaxing hot bath or shower. One of the reasons late-night eating can delay sleep is that it may interfere with the drop in core body temperature that normally occurs about bedtime. That\'s thought to be one of the cues that it\'s time for bed. So, should you not take a hot bath before bed? No, because as soon as you step out of the bath or shower, the rapid decline in skin temperature can accentuate the natural nighttime drop and improve sleep. Even just a warm foot bath may help you fall asleep about 15 minutes faster.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Foods for insomnia.

Force people to go one week with only six hours of sleep a night, and you can change expression of more than 700 genes. The most dire effect may be endothelial dysfunction. The endothelium is the thin layer of cells that covers the internal surface of blood vessels and is responsible for allowing our arteries to relax and dilate back open properly. Randomize people for about a week to get five rather than seven hours of sleep, and just that two-hour difference a night resulted in a significant impairment in artery function. Okay, but what do these numbers mean? How bad is a week of 5-hour nights? Sleep deprivation is no joke. The magnitude of impairment is similar to that reported in people who smoke, have diabetes, or have coronary artery disease. No wonder people who sleep less than seven hours a night may experience a 12% to 35% increased risk of premature death compared to those who get a full seven hours. Yet a significant proportion of the population may routinely get less than that. Sufficiently long, restful sleep sessions each night are said to be an indisputable cornerstone of good health. Okay, so what can we do about it? Those who have sleep apnea, a common consequence of obesity that interferes with sleep, benefit from the use of CPAP machines while they\'re losing the weight to treat the underlying cause, hopefully. But what if apnea isn\'t your problem? What if you just have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep? In my book How Not to Diet, I have a whole section on sleep enhancement, where I go through the Four Rules of Sleep Conditioning and the Four Rules of Sleep Hygiene. What if you follow those guidelines but still can\'t get to sleep? Any natural dietary remedies? I already have videos on using kiwifruit to fight insomnia, and tart cherries, too. Are there any vegetables that might help? Lactuca sativa is a plant that has been traditionally used in the treatment of insomnia. What is this exotic sounding leafy vegetable? Lettuce! Evidently lettuce extracts have been used from the time of the Roman Empire as agents with sedative and sleep-inducing properties. Lettuce actually does have a hypnotic substance in it called lactucin, which is what makes lettuce taste a little bitter. But you don\'t know if it actually works until you put it to the test. And it works...in toads. But it also works in rodents. Sleep in both mice and rats is enhanced by romaine lettuce. They used romaine since it has a higher lactucin content compared to other lettuces. Okay, but does it work in people? About 10 years ago, a study was published in which insomnia sufferers were randomized to receive lettuce seed oil, oil extracted from lettuce seeds. Within a week, about 70% of those in the lettuce seed oil group said their insomnia very much or much improved, compared to only 20% in the placebo control group. The researchers concluded that lettuce seed oil was found to be a useful, safe sleeping aid in geriatric patients suffering from sleeping difficulties. They chose to study older individuals because insomnia affects surprisingly 20 to 40% of older adults at least a few nights a month. You think that\'s bad. Sleep disturbances can plague as many as nearly 8 out of 10 women during pregnancy. Of course, there\'s lots of different sleeping pills, but they may endanger the fetus or mother. For example, doctors frequently prescribe Ambien for pregnant women who have trouble sleeping, but Ambien use is associated with a wide range of adverse pregnancy outcomes like low birth weight babies, premature birth, and cesarean section. And the use of valium during pregnancy has been linked to birth defects including limb deficiencies. There has to be a better way. What about trying lettuce? The lettuce oil study had a number of limitations. For example, it was only single-blind, meaning the researchers knew who was on the lettuce supplements and who was on placebo, which could have introduced some bias. But the researchers essentially said, ""Give us a break. Big pharma has billions to spend on research. No one wants to fund studies on lettuce."" Finally, we got a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, but this time on a whole food, not just a lettuce seed extract. Yeah, but how do you come up with a placebo lettuce? How are you going to hide who  gets lettuce and who doesn\'t? Well, you can\'t fit a head of lettuce into a capsule, but you can fit whole lettuce seeds. And here we go: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial on lettuce seeds for pregnancy-related insomnia. A hundred pregnant women with insomnia were randomized to receive capsules containing either a quarter teaspoon of ground lettuce seeds or a placebo for two weeks, and those on the lettuce seeds saw a significant improvement in a sleep quality index score compared to placebo with no reported side effects.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Did you know you can gain weight if you don’t get enough sleep?

Maybe high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. Well, there’s nothing I like better than bringing you the information that will help you do just that. Welcome to the Nutrition Facts Podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Michael Greger. Today, we discover the health benefits of sleep. And we start with the connection between the lack of sleep and weight gain. Population studies have found short sleep duration has been associated with obesity in both children and adults. Observational studies can never prove cause-and-effect, though. Maybe the obesity is leading to sleep loss instead of the other way around. Obesity can cause arthritis, acid reflux, and apnea, all of which can interfere with sleep. The relationship between obesity and sleep apnea, where your breathing repeatedly stops and starts throughout the night, may be explained by increased tongue fat—fat deposited inside the base of the tongue— that may contribute to obstructing your airway when you sleep on your back. The reverse causation explanation of the link between obesity and inadequate sleep is bolstered by the finding that weight loss interventions can improve daytime sleepiness. Potential confounding factors also abound. For example, people with lower socioeconomic status often work less desirable hours such as rotating or overnight shifts, or may live in noisier neighborhoods with poorer air quality, more crime. The link between inadequate sleep and obesity persists after controlling for these kinds of factors, but you can’t control for everything. You can’t know for sure if sleep deprivation leads to weight gain until you,...put it to the test. Have people pull an all-nighter and they get hungrier and choose larger portions. Randomize people to shave even just a few hours of sleep off every night and they start eating an average of 677 calories more a day compared to the normal sleep control group. Although individual responses vary widely, anywhere from eating 813 calories less per day to as many as 1,437 calories more, on average, studies found sleep deprivation led people to overeat by about 180 to 560 calories a day. Restrict people’s sleep and they also start craving unhealthier choices– more snacks, more foods that are fatty and sugary. Stick people in a brain scanner after staying awake all night, or after few nights of four-hour sleep, and their reward pathways light up brighter in response to high calorie foods. Sleep deprivation bumps the levels of the chief endocannabinoid in the body, the natural chemical we synthesize that binds to the same receptors as the active ingredient in marijuana. This may help explain the nighttime nibbling. On the calories outside of the equation, some short sleepers may take the extra time to exercise; others will be so sleepy they exercise less. The extra wakefulness may raise calorie expenditure up to about 100 calories a day, but if sleep-deprived individuals are overeating hundreds of calories, over time sleep deprivation may end up putting the “wide” in wide awake. With insufficient sleep inadvertently leading to such higher calorie intake, it’s no surprise that 4 out of 5 studies involving as few as 2–5 nights of sleep restriction found an increase in body weight. In other words, if you sleep less, you may gain more OK, but here’s where it gets crazy. Even if you control calorie intake, you still lose more fat when you get more sleep. Overweight subjects who normally got between 6.5 to 8.5 hours of sleep a night were randomized to two weeks of either 8.5 hours of sleep a night or 5.5 hours of sleep on the same calorie- controlled diet. Then the groups switched and spent another two weeks on the opposite regimen. So they spent a month living in the lab so their diets and sleep could be totally controlled and monitored. Just looking at the scales, sleep duration didn’t seem to matter, during both periods they ate the same number of calories and lost the same amount of weight, but most of the weight lost while getting 8.5 hours was fat, whereas most of the weight lost when only getting 5.5 hours of sleep a night was lean body mass. Same diet, but with more sleep they ended up losing more than twice as much body fat. So you snooze you lose… fat! In our next story, we discover how getting just one more hour of sleep a night may help with weight control. I featured a study that found that curtailing sleep can cut your rate of body fat loss in half, while exacerbating the loss of lean mass. To get better insight into what was going on, researchers took fat and muscle biopsies from people after a night of sleep loss. In terms of genes that were turned on and off, molecular signatures were discovered suggesting muscle breakdown and fat buildup. That was after an all-nighter, though, and in the weight-loss study the sleep-restricted groups ended up getting little more than 5 hours a night. What about a more realistic scenario like sleeping just like one hour less a night? Overweight adults were randomized to 8 weeks of a calorie restricted diet or the same diet combined with just 5 days a week of one hour a night less sleep. The sleep restricted group achieved the one hour a day less sleep on weekdays but ended up sleeping an hour more on the weekend days. So overall, they just cut about 3 hours of sleep out of their week. Would just those few hours a week make any weight loss difference? On the scale, no, but in the normal sleep group, 80% of the weight loss was fat, whereas in the group just missing a few hours of sleep a week it was the opposite— 80% of the loss was lean. This shows that a few hours of “catch up sleep” on the weekends is insufficient, and may in fact be contributing to the problem based on “social jetlag” effect I explored in a previous video. A comparable study was designed for kids, but the sleeping periods only lasted a week. Eight- to eleven-year olds were randomized to either increase or decrease their time in bed by 1.5 hours per night for a week and then switch the following week. They ate an average of 134 calories more on the days they slept less and gained in that week about half a pound compared to the sleep-more week. The question then becomes would sleeping more facilitate weight loss? When it comes to body fat, can we just, sleep it off? The benefit of interventional studies is that you can demonstrate cause and effect, but observational studies can allow you to more easily track people and their behaviors over a longer time span. For example, researchers followed a group of mostly overweight individuals who started out to averaging less than six hours of sleep a night for more than five years. During that time, about half maintained that schedule but the other half increased their sleep duration up to seven or eight hours a night and ended up gaining 5 pounds less fat. A study entitled “Sleeping habits predict the magnitude of fat loss” (among those cutting calories) found that every extra hour of sleep at night was associated with an extra 1-and-a-half pounds of weight loss over a period of about 3 to 6 months. That’s not the same as randomizing people to extra sleep, though. Maybe they were sleeping more because they were exercising more and that’s the real reason they lost more weight? Getting people to bump their sleep from about 5.5 hours up to 7 can lead to an overall decrease in appetite within two weeks, particularly for sugary and salty foods. A four-week study getting habitually short sleepers to sleep about an extra hour a night led them to consume about two fewer spoonful’s worth of sugar a day compared to the control group but this didn’t translate into any changes in body composition. A twelve-week study, on the other hand, randomizing overweight and obese individuals to a weight loss intervention with or without a sleep component found that the sleep group lost weight significantly faster. A national cross-sectional survey suggested lower obesity rates among kids in households that regularly ate dinner together as a family, got adequate sleep, and limited screen times, and so Harvard researchers decided to try to... put those behaviors to the test. A six-month randomized trial to improve household routines for obesity prevention among young children resulted in a lower BMI. Normally it’s hard to tease out the effects of multi-component interventions, but in this case exhortations to limit overall TV watching didn’t work, and the families were already eating together 6 days a week and so that didn’t change much either. The only thing they were able to get the kids to significantly alter was their sleep, and so the improved weight outcomes may be attributed at least in part to the ¾ hour average increase in nightly sleep. Overall, most sleep improvement interventions tended to show improved weight loss. I was intrigued to look up the one study that didn’t. The nice thing about systematic reviews (as opposed to so-called “narrative” reviews) is that they exhaustively include mention of every study that meets some prespecified criteria. This keeps reviewers from cherry-picking, but it can also lead to the inclusion of some strange studies. In this case, a randomized controlled trial of didgeridoo playing, the indigenous Australian wind instrument. Those randomized to the didgeridoo to improve their sleep quality did not lose any weight, but they also failed to improve the quality of their sleep (or, likely, that of their neighbors). Did you know that lactucin, the hypnotic component of lettuce, is a natural dietary remedy for insomnia? Here’s the story.

But researchers at MIT dispelled those myths about a decade ago. Tryptophan is one amino acid among many found in proteins, and they all compete with one another for transport across the blood-brain barrier, into the brain. And, since tryptophan is present in most animal proteins in relatively small quantities, it gets muscled out of the way. If you eat plant foods, though, the carbohydrates cause a release of insulin, which causes your muscles to take up the non-tryptophan amino acids as fuel. And so, your tryptophan can be first in line for brain access. Animal foods can even make things worse: “When tryptophan is ingested as part of a protein meal, serum tryptophan levels rise, but brain tryptophan levels decline… due to the mechanism of transport used by tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier.” The tryptophan levels in those given a high-protein turkey, egg, cheese breakfast dropped, whereas in the waffle-OJ group, their tryptophan levels went up. This may actually explain the carbohydrate cravings one sees in PMS— your brain may be trying to get you to boost tryptophan levels to feel better. “Consumption of a carbohydrate-rich, protein-poor evening test meal during the premenstrual period improved depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, fatigue, alertness, and calmness scores [significantly] among patients with premenstrual syndrome.” “Because synthesis of brain serotonin, which is known to be involved in mood and appetite, increases after carbohydrate intake, premenstrual syndrome subjects may overconsume carbohydrates in an attempt to improve their dysphoric mood state.” Ideally, though, it would be more than just carbs— we’ll cover the ideal mixture in tomorrow’s video-of-the-day.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Just because we don’t have evidence that there is a growing epidemic of sleep deprivation, doesn't necessarily mean we are getting enough sleep.

Conventional wisdom has it that over the last 50 years sleep duration has declined in parallel with the increasing prevalence of obesity, suggesting that an epidemic of sleep loss is associated with the epidemic of weight gain. Now, we have triple digit streaming TV channels, smartphones, and tablets to keep us entertained well into the night. ""The hurry and excitement of modern life is quite correctly held to be responsible for much of the insomnia,"" concluded one medical journal editorial. But that was an editorial published in 1894. Are we really sleeping that much less? Since 1905, sleep duration in children and adolescents has declined by a little  over an hour a night. However, child labor wasn\'t outlawed until 1938 though, and so part of the explanation may be due to the exhaustion of sweating it out in the mines, farms, and factories in the early part of the last century. Since 1970, youth sleep duration has only declined about 15 minutes per night, and it\'s not clear if sleep duration in adults has changed much at all. Based on 168 studies of objective measurements of sleep duration, instead of just self-report, sleep duration in adults -- objective total sleep time -- has\'t changed much since 1960. Since 2003, average sleep duration in the United States may have even gone up. Now, of course, just because we don\'t have evidence that there\'s been a growing epidemic of sleep deprivation that doesn\'t necessarily mean we\'re getting enough sleep. Maybe we weren\'t getting enough sleep 50 years ago either, or since Edison\'s lightbulbs, or since candles were invented 5,000 years ago. How might we determine the optimal sleep duration? One way would be to study millions of people and see how many hours a night is associated with the longest lifespan. Sleep is a great mystery. A trait shared across animal species, sleep must be of vital importance to survive natural selection pressures to eliminate such a vulnerable state. Indeed, cringe-worthy experiments have shown that keeping animals awake long enough is fatal within 11 to 32 days. One of the functions of sleep that has been elucidated in recent years is the clearance of toxic waste substances that build up during the day through a newly discovered drainage system in the brain. This could help explain why those who routinely get less than seven hours of sleep at night may be at increased risk of developing cognitive disorders such as dementia. Even a single all-nighter can cause a significant increase in beta amyloid accumulation in critical brain areas, a gummy substance implicated in the development of Alzheimer\'s disease. The lowest risk for developing cognitive impairment was found for those getting seven to eight hours of sleep a night, which is the same optimal range found for diabetes risk, based on 36 studies following more than a million people. The increased risk associated with getting only six hours a night compared to seven or eight is comparable to the increase in diabetes risk linked to physical inactivity. For death from all causes combined, there\'s been more than 50 studies following hundreds of thousands of people for up to 34 years. Sleeping too short and too long are both associated with cutting one\'s life short, with the apparent sweet spot at seven hours a night. Seven hours may seem short, but that may actually be what\'s natural for our species. Scientists studied three isolated pre-industrial societies across two continents and found a surprising uniformity. Despite no electric lighting or gadgets, they stayed up until about three hours after sunset and then typically rose before dawn, accumulating about a solid six and a half hours of sleep out of about seven and a half hours in ""bed."" A mechanism by which excess sleep might be harmful remains elusive, and so the association between increased risk of death and disease and sleeping nine or more hours a night has been largely dismissed as implausible. Maybe its reverse causation, sickness leading to more time in bed instead of vice-versa, or confounding factors such as employment status. After all, who gets to sleep in? Those without a job to get to. However, there is experimental evidence showing negative health effects from insufficient sleep. So in terms of sleeping in the sweet spot, aim for at least seven hours of regular sleep a day.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Sleep and weight loss: Even getting just one more hour of sleep a night may help with weight control.\n\nThis video was based on the sleep section in my book, How Not to Diet, which you can learn more about here (https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-diet/) (all proceeds go to charity), or check out my presentation based on the book: Evidence-Based Weight Loss (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-weight-loss-live-presentation/).\n\nIf you missed the previous video, see Does Lack of Sleep Cause You to Gain Weight?

In my last video, I featured a study that found that curtailing sleep can cut your rate of body fat loss in half, while exacerbating the loss of lean mass. To get better insight into what was going on, researchers took fat and muscle biopsies from people after a night of sleep loss. In terms of genes that were turned on and off, molecular signatures were discovered suggesting muscle breakdown and fat buildup. That was after an all-nighter, though, and in the weight-loss study the sleep-restricted groups ended up getting little more than 5 hours a night. What about a more realistic scenario like sleeping just like one hour less a night? Overweight adults were randomized to 8 weeks of a calorie restricted diet or the same diet combined with just 5 days a week of one hour a night less sleep. The sleep restricted group achieved the one hour a day less sleep on weekdays but ended up sleeping an hour more on the weekend days. So overall, they just cut about 3 hours of sleep out of their week. Would just those few hours a week make any weight loss difference? On the scale, no, but in the normal sleep group, 80% of the weight loss was fat, whereas in the group just missing a few hours of sleep a week it was the opposite— 80% of the loss was lean. This shows that a few hours of “catch up sleep” on the weekends is insufficient, and may in fact be contributing to the problem based on “social jetlag” effect I explored in a previous video. A comparable study was designed for kids, but the sleeping periods only lasted a week. Eight- to eleven-year olds were randomized to either increase or decrease their time in bed by 1.5 hours per night for a week and then switch the following week. They ate an average of 134 calories more on the days they slept less and gained in that week about half a pound compared to the sleep-more week. The question then becomes would sleeping more facilitate weight loss? When it comes to body fat, can we just, sleep it off? The benefit of interventional studies is that you can demonstrate cause and effect, but observational studies can allow you to more easily track people and their behaviors over a longer time span. For example, researchers followed a group of mostly overweight individuals who started out to averaging less than six hours of sleep a night for more than five years. During that time, about half maintained that schedule but the other half increased their sleep duration up to seven or eight hours a night and ended up gaining 5 pounds less fat. A study entitled “Sleeping habits predict the magnitude of fat loss” (among those cutting calories) found that every extra hour of sleep at night was associated with an extra 1-and-a-half pounds of weight loss over a period of about 3 to 6 months. That’s not the same as randomizing people to extra sleep, though. Maybe they were sleeping more because they were exercising more and that’s the real reason they lost more weight? Getting people to bump their sleep from about 5.5 hours up to 7 can lead to an overall decrease in appetite within two weeks, particularly for sugary and salty foods. A four-week study getting habitually short sleepers to sleep about an extra hour a night led them to consume about two fewer spoonful’s worth of sugar a day compared to the control group but this didn’t translate into any changes in body composition. A twelve-week study, on the other hand, randomizing overweight and obese individuals to a weight loss intervention with or without a sleep component found that the sleep group lost weight significantly faster. A national cross-sectional survey suggested lower obesity rates among kids in households that regularly ate dinner together as a family, got adequate sleep, and limited screen times, and so Harvard researchers decided to try to... put those behaviors to the test. A six-month randomized trial to improve household routines for obesity prevention among young children resulted in a lower BMI. Normally it’s hard to tease out the effects of multi-component interventions, but in this case exhortations to limit overall TV watching didn’t work, and the families were already eating together 6 days a week and so that didn’t change much either. The only thing they were able to get the kids to significantly alter was their sleep, and so the improved weight outcomes may be attributed at least in part to the ¾ hour average increase in nightly sleep. Overall, most sleep improvement interventions tended to show improved weight loss. I was intrigued to look up the one study that didn’t. The nice thing about systematic reviews (as opposed to so-called “narrative” reviews) is that they exhaustively include mention of every study that meets some prespecified criteria. This keeps reviewers from cherry-picking, but it can also lead to the inclusion of some strange studies. In this case, a randomized controlled trial of didgeridoo playing, the indigenous Australian wind instrument. Those randomized to the didgeridoo to improve their sleep quality did not lose any weight, but they also failed to improve the quality of their sleep (or, likely, that of their neighbors).')]","There are several foods mentioned in Dr. Michael Greger's videos that could potentially enhance sleep quality and duration, which may help someone feel more rested even if they are already sleeping a sufficient number of hours. Here are some options based on the content provided:

1. **Tart Cherries and Cherry Juice**: Tart cherries are a natural source of melatonin, which can aid in improving sleep quality. Drinking tart cherry juice or consuming tart cherries might help enhance sleep duration and quality.

2. **Kiwifruit**: Consuming two kiwifruits an hour before bedtime has been shown to improve both sleep onset and sleep duration without the side effects associated with sleeping pills. This could be due to its antioxidant properties and possibly its folate content.

3. **Pistachios**: These nuts are incredibly rich in melatonin compared to other foods. Just a small amount of pistachios could significantly increase melatonin levels, potentially improving sleep quality.

4. **Goji Berries**: Also known as a potent source of melatonin, goji berries could help increase melatonin levels in the blood, thus potentially enhancing sleep quality.

5. **Almonds and Walnuts**: These nuts are good sources of melatonin and also contain magnesium, which may help improve sleep quality by reducing inflammation and promoting muscle relaxation.

6. **Flaxseeds**: Although not as potent in melatonin, flaxseeds do contain some amount and are also a good source of omega-3 fatty acids, which have been linked to better sleep.

7. **Lettuce**: Lettuce contains lactucin, which has sedative properties. Lettuce seed oil, in particular, has been shown to improve sleep in clinical studies.

It's important to note that while these foods may aid in enhancing sleep quality, individual responses can vary. It might be beneficial to try incorporating some of these foods into the evening routine to see if they help improve the feeling of restfulness. Additionally, maintaining good sleep hygiene and a consistent sleep schedule are crucial for optimal sleep health. If sleep issues persist, consulting a healthcare provider is recommended.","There are several foods mentioned in Dr. Michael Greger's videos that could potentially enhance sleep quality and duration, which may help someone feel more rested even if they are already sleeping a sufficient number of hours.

We saw from the kiwifruit study  that this seemed possible,  but the mechanism they  suggested for the effect— the serotonin levels in kiwifruit,  doesn\'t make any sense,  since serotonin can\'t cross  the blood-brain barrier.  So you can eat all  the serotonin you want  and it shouldn\'t affect  your brain chemistry. A different brain chemical,  though, melatonin,  can get from our  gut to our brain. Melatonin is a hormone  secreted at night  to help regulate our  circadian rhythms  by the pineal gland in  the center of our brain.  Supplements of the stuff are used  to prevent and reduce jet lag and about 20 years ago  MIT got the patent  to use melatonin to  help people sleep.  Melatonin is not only produced  in the pineal gland, though,  but also is naturally  present in edible plants. That might explain the  results of this study,  the Effects of a Tart Cherry Juice Beverage  on the Sleep of Older Adults with Insomnia. The research group had been  doing an earlier study  on tart cherry juice  as a sports recovery drink.  See, there\'s a  phytonutrient in cherries  with anti-inflammatory effects  on par with drugs like  aspirin, ibuprofen,  so they were trying to  see if they could help  reduce muscle soreness  after exercise  and some of the participants  in the study  just anecdotally said that they were sleeping better  on the cherries. That was unexpected.  But the researchers  realized that  cherries are a plant food  source of melatonin,  so they put it  to the test.  The reason they chose  older subjects is that  melatonin production tends  to drop as we age,  which may be  one reason why  there\'s higher insomnia  rates in the elderly.  So, they took a group of  older men and women suffering from  chronic insomnia  and put half on cherries  and half on placebo.  Now they couldn\'t use whole  cherries for the study,  because how could  you fool people with a fake placebo cherry?  So they used cherry juice  versus ""cherry Koolaid,""  and found significant but  modest improvements in sleep,  so for example fell to  sleep a few minutes faster,  and had 17 fewer minutes of  waking after sleep onset,  meaning, waking up in  the middle of the night.  So it was no  insomnia cure,  but it helped without  side effects. How do we know it was  the melatonin, though?  They repeated the study,  this time measuring  the melatonin levels  and indeed saw a boost in  circulating melatonin levels after the cherry juice,  but not after the koolaid. Similar results were found  in people eating  the actual cherries— 7 different varieties,  boosting melatonin levels  and actual sleep times.  The effects of all the other  phytonutrients in cherries  can\'t be precluded,  maybe they helped too, but if it is the melatonin,  there are more potent  sources than cherries. Orange bell peppers  have a bit,  an ounce of walnuts.  A tablespoon  of flaxseeds  has about as much  as a tomato,  all less than the tart  cherries that were tested,  but people may eat a lot more  tomatoes than cherries,  especially tart cherries.  Sweet cherries have 50 times  less melatonin than tart  and dried cherries  appear to have none.  In fact, the melatonin  content of tomatoes  was suggested as  one of the reasons traditional Mediterranean  diets were so healthy.  A few spices are  pretty potent,  just a teaspoon of fenugreek  seeds or mustard seeds  has about as much  as a few tomatoes, but the bronze, silver,  and gold go to  almonds, raspberries, and  goji berries off the charts. Now even gojis just have  15 micrograms an ounce,  but melatonin is potent stuff.  You inject just  10 into people  and you can boost their blood  levels 50 fold in 5 minutes.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

After literally hundreds of  studies we still don\'t know  the best answer to  either question. A few years ago I featured a large  hundred thousand-person study suggesting that ""Both short  and long sleep duration""  ""were associated with  increased mortality""  with people getting around  7 hours of sleep living longest. Since then a meta-analysis  of all such studies  including more than a  million people was published,  and they found  the same thing.  We still don\'t know, though,  if sleep duration is a cause,  or simply a marker  of ill health. Maybe sleeping too  little or too long  does make you unhealthy, or maybe we see the associated  lifespan shortening  because being unhealthy causes you  to sleep shorter or longer. Similar work has now been published  on cognitive function.  After controlling for  a long list of factors,  men and women in their 50s  and 60s getting 7 or 8 hours  appeared to have the  best short-term memory,  compared to those that  got much more or much less.  Same thing was just demonstrated  with immune function:  ""both reduced and prolonged  habitual sleep durations""  ""were associated with an  increased risk of pneumonia"". It\'s easy to prevent over  sleeping-- set an alarm.  But what if your problem  is not getting enough?  What if you\'re the 1 in  3 adults that suffers  symptoms of insomnia?  Sure there are drugs like  valium you can take for insomnia in  the short term, but they have a number  of adverse side effects  and non-pharmacological approaches such as cognitive behavioral  therapy are often difficult,  time-consuming, and  don\'t always work.  Wouldn\'t it be great to  have ""natural treatments  ""that can improve both sleep  onset and help patients""  ""improve the quality of  sleep while improving""  ""next-day symptoms  over the long term""?  The ""Effect of kiwifruit consumption on  sleep quality in adults with sleep problems.""  Two kiwi fruit an hour before  bed every night for four weeks.  Why study kiwifruits?  Well, people with sleep  disorders tend to have high levels of oxidative stress  so maybe antioxidant  rich foods may help,  but all fruits and vegetables  have antioxidants.  Ah, but kiwifruits contain twice  the serotonin of tomatoes,  but it really shouldn\'t cross  the blood/brain barrier.  Kiwifruit has folate,  and a deficiency might cause insomnia,  but there\'s lots more folate  in some other plant foods.  The reason they studied  kiwifruits is because they got grant money  from a kiwifruit company,  and I\'m glad they did  because they found  some really remarkable results:  significantly improved sleep onset,  duration, and efficiency  using both subjective and  objective measurements.  Went from sleeping  6 hours a night to 7,  just eating a few kiwifruit.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'There may be a way to get the benefits of over-the-counter melatonin supplements without the risk.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

For these reasons,  melatonin supplements cannot be recommended. Too bad there’s no way you can get the benefits without the risks— unless, melatonin was  somehow found naturally in certain foods you could eat. Melatonin was first discovered in plants in 1995 and has since been found throughout the plant kingdom. But, enough that eating them actually affects your levels? Yes. You randomize people to eat more or fewer vegetables, and you can see the effect. Hard to get people to  eat vegetables though. How about beer? The melatonin present in beer contributes to an increase in the levels of melatonin in the human bloodstream. Though, alcohol consumption  may actually mess with your own endogenous melatonin secretion; so, beer probably isn’t the best choice. Eat two bananas, or drink the juice of about 2 pounds of  oranges or pineapple, and you can get significant bumps in melatonin concentrations in your blood, and the melatonin levels found in those fruits are pretty modest, compared to some other foods. Here’s the breakdown. The single food within each category with the highest recorded melatonin level, and how much you’d have to eat at one time to reach a physiological dose in your bloodstream. We make melatonin; so, it should come as no surprise that other animals do too. The most melatonin-rich meat tested was salmon, but because there were only billionths of a gram per serving, you’d have to sit down and eat about 200 pounds to get the effect. OK. So, forget meat. What about whole grains? The highest recorded was a strain of corn so rich in melatonin you’d only have to eat 16 ears of corn. All right, scratch that. What about other vegetables? Plain white button mushrooms  top the list. Only two pounds. A hundred times more  melatonin than meat, but still, they’re so light, 2 pounds is like eating 10 cups of mushrooms. That’s a lot in one sitting. Thankfully, cranberries to the rescue, the most melatonin-rich fruit. Just a single ounce, and it’s like you just took a melatonin supplement, with only good side effects, other than, of course, the extreme sourness. That’s about a third of a cup of cranberries. They’re pretty sturdy; so, you could travel without them getting smooshed, but what do you do with them once you get there. Easy to blend into a smoothie, but what if you’re stuck in a hotel? Can you eat dried cranberries, like what are they called—craisins? A study of various tart cherry products suggests that the drying process wipes out the melatonin; so, no melatonin in dried cherries and presumably dried cranberries either, nor in juice. The level of melatonin in cherry juice concentrate was almost nondetectable; so, drinking cranberry juice would also presumably be a wash, which brings us to nuts. Pistachios are not just the most melatonin-rich nut, they are simply off-the-charts as the most melatonin-rich food ever recorded. To get a physiological dose of melatonin, all you have to eat is two. Two what? Just two pistachios. Check it out; here are the data. More than 200 micrograms of melatonin per gram, point two milligrams per gram. And, you can get the normal daily spike your brain gives you by taking just 0.3 micrograms: so, just two nuts. So, taking a whole handful of pistachio nuts is like taking one of those high dose melatonin supplements. So, the best food for jet lag appears to be appropriately  timed pistachios.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Taking less than just 18 Ambien-class sleeping pills in an entire year may triple the risk of dying prematurely.\n\nIs Six Hours of Sleep Enough?

Even if that was all due to the difference in sleep, that\'s still only 6 pounds for 10,000+ more hours of sleep. If even a tiny fraction of that time was spent on diet and exercise, you know, biking to the nearest farm stand, more weight could have been lost in 16 weeks than in those 16 years. Every little bit helps, though, and getting at least seven hours is healthier for you anyway. This biggest reason to lose sleep over losing sleep is motor vehicle accident risk. Driving drowsy increases your risk of killing yourself and others. People might think twice about getting behind the wheel after staying awake for 48 hours straight, but even just two weeks of sleeping 6 hours a night impairs your cognitive performance as much as pulling two all-nighters in a row. So, what\'s the best way to sleep better? Sleeping pills are a nonstarter. Those prescribed even less than 18 pills a year of so-called hypnotics, the class of sleeping pills that includes Ambien, appear to have triple the risk of dying prematurely. Since up to 10% of the adult population is prescribed these drugs, if the drugs really are killing people, that could mean a six-figure death toll every year. Ambien\'s manufacturer questioned the study, but that\'s just one of dozens of studies that found a significant association between sleeping pills and premature death. When the principal investigator at the Scripps Clinic Sleep Center was criticized for reporting alarmingly high death risks from these commonly used medications, he replied: ""We can\'t hide risks, even if they might frighten patients out of taking hypnotics. Patients have a right to know."" What\'s more, non-pharmacological methods have been found to work as good or better than the drugs. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is what\'s called ""cognitive behavioral therapy, "" which combines conditioning techniques to re-associate the bed with sleep and education surrounding optimal sleep hygiene. Here are the four rules of sleep conditioning. (1) Go to bed only when you\'re sleepy. (2) Only use the bed for sleep (and sex). No reading, eating, or screen time. (3) If you can\'t fall asleep within about 15-20 minutes, get up, leave the bedroom, and don\'t come back until you\'re sleepy again. And repeat as necessary. And finally (4), get up at the same time every morning, no matter how little sleep you get. And although avoiding napping is often added, contrary to expectations, the majority of research does not show that daytime naps interfere with nighttime sleep. If there were four rules of sleep hygiene I\'d pick out, it would be (1): exercise regularly. The best time to exercise to improve sleep appears to be 4 to 8 hours before bedtime, though it appears to be a myth that exercising right before bed is somehow disruptive to sleep. (2) Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bedtime. We used to think as long as you don\'t drink caffeine in the evening, it wouldn\'t affect sleep, but four cups of coffee worth even six hours before bedtime can reduce total sleep time by more than an hour. Even just two cups in the morning at 7 a.m. can change what your brainwaves look like on EEG that night, though it\'s not clear if this has any clinical relevance beyond delaying the onset of sleep by an average of 10 minutes. Late afternoon alcohol consumption (6 hours before bedtime) may also impair sleep, even after it\'s cleared out of your system. And nicotine, whether from gum, pill, patch, or cigarette, can also have negative sleep effects, though so too can active nicotine withdrawal. Food-wise, low fiber intakes and high saturated fat and sugar intake is associated with lighter, less restorative sleep. Meat intake is associated with napping, suggested as a proxy for sleepiness. This may be one of the reasons insomnia has been reported as a side-effect of low carb, ketogenic diets. Supplement-wise, a single megadose of vitamin D was found to improve sleep duration and quality in men and women ages 20 through 50 with sleeping disorders. And I\'ve already talked about melatonin-rich foods and supplements in previous videos. (3) Make the bedroom quiet, dark, cool, and comfortable. Nocturnal noise can adversely impact sleep even if we\'re not consciously aware of it. Within a few days, you can become habituated to noises such that they don\'t wake you up, but EEG studies and subjective sleep surveys show the quality of your sleep can still be affected. Thankfully, ear plugs and sound masking, like white noise machines, have been shown to help. And finally (4), establish a relaxing bedtime routine. Relaxation techniques such as massage, mindfulness meditation, and soothing music may also help. So may taking a relaxing hot bath or shower. One of the reasons late-night eating can delay sleep is that it may interfere with the drop in core body temperature that normally occurs about bedtime. That\'s thought to be one of the cues that it\'s time for bed. So, should you not take a hot bath before bed? No, because as soon as you step out of the bath or shower, the rapid decline in skin temperature can accentuate the natural nighttime drop and improve sleep. Even just a warm foot bath may help you fall asleep about 15 minutes faster.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Foods for insomnia.

Force people to go one week with only six hours of sleep a night, and you can change expression of more than 700 genes. The most dire effect may be endothelial dysfunction. The endothelium is the thin layer of cells that covers the internal surface of blood vessels and is responsible for allowing our arteries to relax and dilate back open properly. Randomize people for about a week to get five rather than seven hours of sleep, and just that two-hour difference a night resulted in a significant impairment in artery function. Okay, but what do these numbers mean? How bad is a week of 5-hour nights? Sleep deprivation is no joke. The magnitude of impairment is similar to that reported in people who smoke, have diabetes, or have coronary artery disease. No wonder people who sleep less than seven hours a night may experience a 12% to 35% increased risk of premature death compared to those who get a full seven hours. Yet a significant proportion of the population may routinely get less than that. Sufficiently long, restful sleep sessions each night are said to be an indisputable cornerstone of good health. Okay, so what can we do about it? Those who have sleep apnea, a common consequence of obesity that interferes with sleep, benefit from the use of CPAP machines while they\'re losing the weight to treat the underlying cause, hopefully. But what if apnea isn\'t your problem? What if you just have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep? In my book How Not to Diet, I have a whole section on sleep enhancement, where I go through the Four Rules of Sleep Conditioning and the Four Rules of Sleep Hygiene. What if you follow those guidelines but still can\'t get to sleep? Any natural dietary remedies? I already have videos on using kiwifruit to fight insomnia, and tart cherries, too. Are there any vegetables that might help? Lactuca sativa is a plant that has been traditionally used in the treatment of insomnia. What is this exotic sounding leafy vegetable? Lettuce! Evidently lettuce extracts have been used from the time of the Roman Empire as agents with sedative and sleep-inducing properties. Lettuce actually does have a hypnotic substance in it called lactucin, which is what makes lettuce taste a little bitter. But you don\'t know if it actually works until you put it to the test. And it works...in toads. But it also works in rodents. Sleep in both mice and rats is enhanced by romaine lettuce. They used romaine since it has a higher lactucin content compared to other lettuces. Okay, but does it work in people? About 10 years ago, a study was published in which insomnia sufferers were randomized to receive lettuce seed oil, oil extracted from lettuce seeds. Within a week, about 70% of those in the lettuce seed oil group said their insomnia very much or much improved, compared to only 20% in the placebo control group. The researchers concluded that lettuce seed oil was found to be a useful, safe sleeping aid in geriatric patients suffering from sleeping difficulties. They chose to study older individuals because insomnia affects surprisingly 20 to 40% of older adults at least a few nights a month. You think that\'s bad. Sleep disturbances can plague as many as nearly 8 out of 10 women during pregnancy. Of course, there\'s lots of different sleeping pills, but they may endanger the fetus or mother. For example, doctors frequently prescribe Ambien for pregnant women who have trouble sleeping, but Ambien use is associated with a wide range of adverse pregnancy outcomes like low birth weight babies, premature birth, and cesarean section. And the use of valium during pregnancy has been linked to birth defects including limb deficiencies. There has to be a better way. What about trying lettuce? The lettuce oil study had a number of limitations. For example, it was only single-blind, meaning the researchers knew who was on the lettuce supplements and who was on placebo, which could have introduced some bias. But the researchers essentially said, ""Give us a break. Big pharma has billions to spend on research. No one wants to fund studies on lettuce."" Finally, we got a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, but this time on a whole food, not just a lettuce seed extract. Yeah, but how do you come up with a placebo lettuce? How are you going to hide who  gets lettuce and who doesn\'t? Well, you can\'t fit a head of lettuce into a capsule, but you can fit whole lettuce seeds. And here we go: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial on lettuce seeds for pregnancy-related insomnia. A hundred pregnant women with insomnia were randomized to receive capsules containing either a quarter teaspoon of ground lettuce seeds or a placebo for two weeks, and those on the lettuce seeds saw a significant improvement in a sleep quality index score compared to placebo with no reported side effects.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Did you know you can gain weight if you don’t get enough sleep?

Maybe high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. Well, there’s nothing I like better than bringing you the information that will help you do just that. Welcome to the Nutrition Facts Podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Michael Greger. Today, we discover the health benefits of sleep. And we start with the connection between the lack of sleep and weight gain. Population studies have found short sleep duration has been associated with obesity in both children and adults. Observational studies can never prove cause-and-effect, though. Maybe the obesity is leading to sleep loss instead of the other way around. Obesity can cause arthritis, acid reflux, and apnea, all of which can interfere with sleep. The relationship between obesity and sleep apnea, where your breathing repeatedly stops and starts throughout the night, may be explained by increased tongue fat—fat deposited inside the base of the tongue— that may contribute to obstructing your airway when you sleep on your back. The reverse causation explanation of the link between obesity and inadequate sleep is bolstered by the finding that weight loss interventions can improve daytime sleepiness. Potential confounding factors also abound. For example, people with lower socioeconomic status often work less desirable hours such as rotating or overnight shifts, or may live in noisier neighborhoods with poorer air quality, more crime. The link between inadequate sleep and obesity persists after controlling for these kinds of factors, but you can’t control for everything. You can’t know for sure if sleep deprivation leads to weight gain until you,...put it to the test. Have people pull an all-nighter and they get hungrier and choose larger portions. Randomize people to shave even just a few hours of sleep off every night and they start eating an average of 677 calories more a day compared to the normal sleep control group. Although individual responses vary widely, anywhere from eating 813 calories less per day to as many as 1,437 calories more, on average, studies found sleep deprivation led people to overeat by about 180 to 560 calories a day. Restrict people’s sleep and they also start craving unhealthier choices– more snacks, more foods that are fatty and sugary. Stick people in a brain scanner after staying awake all night, or after few nights of four-hour sleep, and their reward pathways light up brighter in response to high calorie foods. Sleep deprivation bumps the levels of the chief endocannabinoid in the body, the natural chemical we synthesize that binds to the same receptors as the active ingredient in marijuana. This may help explain the nighttime nibbling. On the calories outside of the equation, some short sleepers may take the extra time to exercise; others will be so sleepy they exercise less. The extra wakefulness may raise calorie expenditure up to about 100 calories a day, but if sleep-deprived individuals are overeating hundreds of calories, over time sleep deprivation may end up putting the “wide” in wide awake. With insufficient sleep inadvertently leading to such higher calorie intake, it’s no surprise that 4 out of 5 studies involving as few as 2–5 nights of sleep restriction found an increase in body weight. In other words, if you sleep less, you may gain more OK, but here’s where it gets crazy. Even if you control calorie intake, you still lose more fat when you get more sleep. Overweight subjects who normally got between 6.5 to 8.5 hours of sleep a night were randomized to two weeks of either 8.5 hours of sleep a night or 5.5 hours of sleep on the same calorie- controlled diet. Then the groups switched and spent another two weeks on the opposite regimen. So they spent a month living in the lab so their diets and sleep could be totally controlled and monitored. Just looking at the scales, sleep duration didn’t seem to matter, during both periods they ate the same number of calories and lost the same amount of weight, but most of the weight lost while getting 8.5 hours was fat, whereas most of the weight lost when only getting 5.5 hours of sleep a night was lean body mass. Same diet, but with more sleep they ended up losing more than twice as much body fat. So you snooze you lose… fat! In our next story, we discover how getting just one more hour of sleep a night may help with weight control. I featured a study that found that curtailing sleep can cut your rate of body fat loss in half, while exacerbating the loss of lean mass. To get better insight into what was going on, researchers took fat and muscle biopsies from people after a night of sleep loss. In terms of genes that were turned on and off, molecular signatures were discovered suggesting muscle breakdown and fat buildup. That was after an all-nighter, though, and in the weight-loss study the sleep-restricted groups ended up getting little more than 5 hours a night. What about a more realistic scenario like sleeping just like one hour less a night? Overweight adults were randomized to 8 weeks of a calorie restricted diet or the same diet combined with just 5 days a week of one hour a night less sleep. The sleep restricted group achieved the one hour a day less sleep on weekdays but ended up sleeping an hour more on the weekend days. So overall, they just cut about 3 hours of sleep out of their week. Would just those few hours a week make any weight loss difference? On the scale, no, but in the normal sleep group, 80% of the weight loss was fat, whereas in the group just missing a few hours of sleep a week it was the opposite— 80% of the loss was lean. This shows that a few hours of “catch up sleep” on the weekends is insufficient, and may in fact be contributing to the problem based on “social jetlag” effect I explored in a previous video. A comparable study was designed for kids, but the sleeping periods only lasted a week. Eight- to eleven-year olds were randomized to either increase or decrease their time in bed by 1.5 hours per night for a week and then switch the following week. They ate an average of 134 calories more on the days they slept less and gained in that week about half a pound compared to the sleep-more week. The question then becomes would sleeping more facilitate weight loss? When it comes to body fat, can we just, sleep it off? The benefit of interventional studies is that you can demonstrate cause and effect, but observational studies can allow you to more easily track people and their behaviors over a longer time span. For example, researchers followed a group of mostly overweight individuals who started out to averaging less than six hours of sleep a night for more than five years. During that time, about half maintained that schedule but the other half increased their sleep duration up to seven or eight hours a night and ended up gaining 5 pounds less fat. A study entitled “Sleeping habits predict the magnitude of fat loss” (among those cutting calories) found that every extra hour of sleep at night was associated with an extra 1-and-a-half pounds of weight loss over a period of about 3 to 6 months. That’s not the same as randomizing people to extra sleep, though. Maybe they were sleeping more because they were exercising more and that’s the real reason they lost more weight? Getting people to bump their sleep from about 5.5 hours up to 7 can lead to an overall decrease in appetite within two weeks, particularly for sugary and salty foods. A four-week study getting habitually short sleepers to sleep about an extra hour a night led them to consume about two fewer spoonful’s worth of sugar a day compared to the control group but this didn’t translate into any changes in body composition. A twelve-week study, on the other hand, randomizing overweight and obese individuals to a weight loss intervention with or without a sleep component found that the sleep group lost weight significantly faster. A national cross-sectional survey suggested lower obesity rates among kids in households that regularly ate dinner together as a family, got adequate sleep, and limited screen times, and so Harvard researchers decided to try to... put those behaviors to the test. A six-month randomized trial to improve household routines for obesity prevention among young children resulted in a lower BMI. Normally it’s hard to tease out the effects of multi-component interventions, but in this case exhortations to limit overall TV watching didn’t work, and the families were already eating together 6 days a week and so that didn’t change much either. The only thing they were able to get the kids to significantly alter was their sleep, and so the improved weight outcomes may be attributed at least in part to the ¾ hour average increase in nightly sleep. Overall, most sleep improvement interventions tended to show improved weight loss. I was intrigued to look up the one study that didn’t.

In my last video, I featured a study that found that curtailing sleep can cut your rate of body fat loss in half, while exacerbating the loss of lean mass. To get better insight into what was going on, researchers took fat and muscle biopsies from people after a night of sleep loss. In terms of genes that were turned on and off, molecular signatures were discovered suggesting muscle breakdown and fat buildup. That was after an all-nighter, though, and in the weight-loss study the sleep-restricted groups ended up getting little more than 5 hours a night. What about a more realistic scenario like sleeping just like one hour less a night? Overweight adults were randomized to 8 weeks of a calorie restricted diet or the same diet combined with just 5 days a week of one hour a night less sleep. The sleep restricted group achieved the one hour a day less sleep on weekdays but ended up sleeping an hour more on the weekend days. So overall, they just cut about 3 hours of sleep out of their week. Would just those few hours a week make any weight loss difference? On the scale, no, but in the normal sleep group, 80% of the weight loss was fat, whereas in the group just missing a few hours of sleep a week it was the opposite— 80% of the loss was lean. This shows that a few hours of “catch up sleep” on the weekends is insufficient, and may in fact be contributing to the problem based on “social jetlag” effect I explored in a previous video. A comparable study was designed for kids, but the sleeping periods only lasted a week. Eight- to eleven-year olds were randomized to either increase or decrease their time in bed by 1.5 hours per night for a week and then switch the following week. They ate an average of 134 calories more on the days they slept less and gained in that week about half a pound compared to the sleep-more week. The question then becomes would sleeping more facilitate weight loss? When it comes to body fat, can we just, sleep it off? The benefit of interventional studies is that you can demonstrate cause and effect, but observational studies can allow you to more easily track people and their behaviors over a longer time span. For example, researchers followed a group of mostly overweight individuals who started out to averaging less than six hours of sleep a night for more than five years. During that time, about half maintained that schedule but the other half increased their sleep duration up to seven or eight hours a night and ended up gaining 5 pounds less fat. A study entitled “Sleeping habits predict the magnitude of fat loss” (among those cutting calories) found that every extra hour of sleep at night was associated with an extra 1-and-a-half pounds of weight loss over a period of about 3 to 6 months. That’s not the same as randomizing people to extra sleep, though. Maybe they were sleeping more because they were exercising more and that’s the real reason they lost more weight? Getting people to bump their sleep from about 5.5 hours up to 7 can lead to an overall decrease in appetite within two weeks, particularly for sugary and salty foods. A four-week study getting habitually short sleepers to sleep about an extra hour a night led them to consume about two fewer spoonful’s worth of sugar a day compared to the control group but this didn’t translate into any changes in body composition. A twelve-week study, on the other hand, randomizing overweight and obese individuals to a weight loss intervention with or without a sleep component found that the sleep group lost weight significantly faster. A national cross-sectional survey suggested lower obesity rates among kids in households that regularly ate dinner together as a family, got adequate sleep, and limited screen times, and so Harvard researchers decided to try to... put those behaviors to the test. A six-month randomized trial to improve household routines for obesity prevention among young children resulted in a lower BMI. Normally it’s hard to tease out the effects of multi-component interventions, but in this case exhortations to limit overall TV watching didn’t work, and the families were already eating together 6 days a week and so that didn’t change much either. The only thing they were able to get the kids to significantly alter was their sleep, and so the improved weight outcomes may be attributed at least in part to the ¾ hour average increase in nightly sleep. Overall, most sleep improvement interventions tended to show improved weight loss. I was intrigued to look up the one study that didn’t. The nice thing about systematic reviews (as opposed to so-called “narrative” reviews) is that they exhaustively include mention of every study that meets some prespecified criteria. This keeps reviewers from cherry-picking, but it can also lead to the inclusion of some strange studies.

Carbohydrates, on the other hand, can boost transport across the blood-brain barrier, which has been used to explain premenstrual cravings.

But researchers at MIT dispelled those myths about a decade ago. Tryptophan is one amino acid among many found in proteins, and they all compete with one another for transport across the blood-brain barrier, into the brain. And, since tryptophan is present in most animal proteins in relatively small quantities, it gets muscled out of the way. If you eat plant foods, though, the carbohydrates cause a release of insulin, which causes your muscles to take up the non-tryptophan amino acids as fuel. And so, your tryptophan can be first in line for brain access. Animal foods can even make things worse: “When tryptophan is ingested as part of a protein meal, serum tryptophan levels rise, but brain tryptophan levels decline… due to the mechanism of transport used by tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier.” The tryptophan levels in those given a high-protein turkey, egg, cheese breakfast dropped, whereas in the waffle-OJ group, their tryptophan levels went up. This may actually explain the carbohydrate cravings one sees in PMS— your brain may be trying to get you to boost tryptophan levels to feel better. “Consumption of a carbohydrate-rich, protein-poor evening test meal during the premenstrual period improved depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, fatigue, alertness, and calmness scores [significantly] among patients with premenstrual syndrome.” “Because synthesis of brain serotonin, which is known to be involved in mood and appetite, increases after carbohydrate intake, premenstrual syndrome subjects may overconsume carbohydrates in an attempt to improve their dysphoric mood state.” Ideally, though, it would be more than just carbs— we’ll cover the ideal mixture in tomorrow’s video-of-the-day.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'What are the effects of spinach and berries on oxidative stress, inflammation, and muscle soreness in athletes?\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

What happens when you  put foods to the test? Well, no positive influence ingesting chia seed oil on human running performance, but there was an effect found for spinach supplementation on exercise-induced oxidation stress. And by spinach supplementation, they meant they just gave some guys some fresh raw spinach leaves, one gram per kilo, so like a quarter of a bunch a day for two weeks and then they had them  run a half marathon. And, they found that “chronic daily oral supplementation of spinach,” uh meaning like eating a salad, has alleviating effects on known markers of oxidative stress and muscle damage, Here’s what happens when you run a half marathon without spinach: a big spike in oxidative stress, blood malondealdehyde levels, that stay up hours or even days later. In the spinach group, the before and after 2 weeks of spinach doesn’t seem to make much of a difference, but put the body under pressure, and then you can really see the difference. Your body is better able to deal with the stress. And, if you look at the resulting muscle damage, as measured by creatine kinase  leakage from your muscles (that\'s an enzyme that should  be in your muscles, not leaking out into your blood), you start out at about 100 and go up to 200 after the half marathon, right after, 2 hours later. But it’s the next day where you really feel it, that delayed onset muscle soreness, with CK levels reaching 600 before coming back down. Okay, that’s without spinach, though. On spinach, you get a similar immediate post-race bump, but it’s that next day where spinach really shines. You don’t get that same next-day spike, and so, for a competitive athlete, that quicker recovery may get you back training harder sooner. They attribute this to the anti- inflammatory effects of spinach. Same with black currant juice. After some hardcore weight lifting, muscle damage indicators  go up and stay up, whereas the same lifting drinking berries, and it goes up, but  comes right back down. But these were just measures of a biomarker of muscle soreness. What about actual soreness? If you look at the effects of tart cherry juice on recovery following prolonged, intermittent sprints in soccer players, you see the same kind of reduction in biomarkers of inflammation, but more importantly, less resulting muscle soreness. Here’s the soreness reported in the days afterwards in the placebo group. Only about half in the cherry group. Then, they measured maximum voluntary isometric contractions of the leg muscles, which understandably took a hit in the days after the intense workout, but not in the cherry group. They conclude that participants supplemented with a tart cherry concentrate were able to maintain greater  functional performance. But, that was testing like how high can you vertically jump. They didn’t actually see if they played soccer any better. But, this study on purple grape juice actually showed an ergogenic effect in recreational runners by promoting increased time to exhaustion, where you ramp people up on a treadmill and see how long they  can go before collapsing.

According to the data from Dr. Michael Greger's videos, foods like tart cherries, kiwifruit, and goji berries (also known as lycium berries) are particularly noted for their potential to enhance sleep quality due to their melatonin content. Melatonin is a hormone that helps regulate sleep cycles and is naturally present in these foods. 

For example, consuming two kiwifruit an hour before bedtime may improve sleep quality and duration without the side effects associated with sleeping pills. Similarly, the consumption of tart cherry juice has been associated with modest improvements in sleep, such as falling asleep a few minutes faster and experiencing fewer minutes of waking after sleep onset.

Therefore, incorporating these melatonin-rich foods into your diet might help in achieving better deep sleep according to fitness watch data that tracks sleep stages.","To improve deep sleep, adding certain plant-based foods rich in melatonin to your diet could be beneficial.

If you remember, we learned our gut bacteria can create anti-obesity compounds from fiber, that’s why they had also had a cookie group. Three apples, three pears, or three cookies with enough oats in them to have about the same amount of fiber as the fruit. Despite the fiber, adding cookies to one’s diet does not lead to weight loss. They think the weight- reducing secret of fruit is it’s low energy density, meaning you get a lot of food for just a few calories, and so it fills you up. Energy density is a relatively new concept that has been identified as an important factor in body weight control in both adults and in children and adolescents. Energy density is defined as the amount of calories per unit weight of a food or beverage. Water, for example, provides a significant amount of weight without adding calories. Fiber too. Thus, foods high in  fiber and water are generally lower in energy density. On the other hand, because dietary fat provides the greatest amount of calories per unit weight, foods high in fat are generally high in energy density. The CDC offers some examples. High energy density foods are like bacon— lots of calories in a small package. A medium energy density food is like a bagel, and low density foods are typified by fruits and vegetables. In general, the lower the better, with two exceptions. Soda is so heavy that by energy density it looks less harmful than it is. And nuts have so much fat they appear less healthy than they are. Otherwise, though, the science supports a relationship between energy density and body weight, such that consuming diets lower in energy density may be an effective strategy for weight control. This is because people tend to eat a consistent weight of food, so when there’s less calories per pound, calorie intake is reduced. A small drop in energy density can lead to a small drop in weight, and the greater the decrease in energy density the greater the weight loss. Energy density can be reduced in a variety of ways such as the addition of vegetables or fruits to recipes or by lowering the fat or sugar content. And indeed that’s how we evolved, eating predominantly low energy density foods such as fruits, vegetables, plants and tubers, starch-filled roots like sweet potatoes. The first study to emphasize how fruits and vegetables could affect energy density and food intake was conducted more than 30 years ago. Researchers were able to cut people’s caloric intake nearly in half, from 3000 calories a day down to 1570 without cutting portions, just by substituting less calorie dense foods, which means lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans, compared to a high energy density meal with lots of meat and sugar. Nearly half the calories, but they enjoyed the meals just as much. They tried this in Hawaii, putting folks on a traditional Hawaiian diet with all the plant foods they could eat. They lost an average of 17 pounds in just 21 days, resulting in better cholesterol, triglycerides, blood sugars, and blood pressure. Caloric intake dropped 40%, but not by eating less food. In fact they lost 17 pounds in 21 days eating more food- four pounds of food. But because plants tend to be so calorically dilute, one can stuff oneself without getting the same kind of weight gain. And the energy density of foods is of interest for weight management not only because it allows people to eat satisfying portions while limiting calories, but also because reductions in energy density are associated with improved dietary quality. For example, lower energy dense diets are associated with lower risk of pancreatic cancer. Lower energy dense diets tend to be of healthier foods, so we get the best of both worlds.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Energy density explains how a study can show participants lose an average of 17 pounds within 21 days while eating a greater quantity of food.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

That\'s why your 10th bite of chocolate, for example, doesn\'t taste as good as the first bite. We have a built-in biological drive to get us to keep changing up our foods, so we\'ll be more likely to hit all of our nutritional requirements. The drive is so powerful that even imagined consumption reduces actual consumption. If you have someone imagine they\'re eating cheese, for example, over and over, and then you give them actual cheese, they eat less of it than those who hadn\'t been imagining they were eating cheese. Ironically, habituation may be one of the reasons fad ""mono diets"" like the cabbage soup diet and the oatmeal diet, or meal replacement shakes can actually result in better adherence and lower ratings of hunger compared to less restrictive diets. In the landmark study ""A Satiety Index of Common Foods,"" in which dozens of foods were put to the test, boiled potatoes were found to be the most satiating food. 240 calories of boiled potatoes were found to be more satisfying in terms of quelling hunger than the same number of calories of any other food tested. No other food even came close. No doubt potatoes\' low-calorie density played a role. For people to eat 240 calories of spuds, the researchers had to feed them nearly a pound of potatoes, compared to just a few cookies, for example, but that\'s kind of the point. They had to feed people even more apples, grapes, and oranges, though, yet each fruit was still about 40% less satiating than the potatoes. So, an all-potato diet would probably take the gold—the Yukon gold—for the most bland, monotonous, and satiating diet. Mono diets, where you just eat one thing, are the poster child for unsustainability however, and thank heavens for that. Over time they can lead to serious nutrient deficiencies, like blindness from vitamin A deficiency in the case of white potatoes. The satiating power of potatoes can still be brought to bear, though. Boiled potatoes beat out rice and pasta in terms of a satiating side dish, cutting as much as about 200 calories of intake off a meal. Compared to boiled and mashed potatoes, French fries or even baked ones do not appear to have the same satiating impact. To exploit habituation for weight loss while maintaining nutrient abundance, you could limit the variety of unhealthy foods you eat, while expanding the variety of healthy foods. In that way you can simultaneously take advantage of the appetite suppressing effects of monotony while diversifying your fruit and vegetable portfolio. Studies have shown that a greater variety of calorie dense foods like sweets and snacks are associated with excess body fat, but a greater vegetable variety appeared protective. Presented with a greater variety of fruit, a greater variety of vegetables, and greater variety of vegetable seasonings, people may consume a greater quantity, crowding out less healthy options. For the first 20 years of the official Dietary Guidelines for Americans, they recommended generally eating a variety of foods. In the new millennium they\'ve started getting more precise, specifying a diversity of healthier foods only. As a pair of Harvard and NYU dietitians concluded in a paper on dietary variety as an overlooked strategy for obesity and chronic disease control, ""Choose and prepare a greater variety of plant-based foods,"" recognizing that a greater variety of less healthy options could be counterproductive. So, how can we respond to industry attempts to lure us into temptation by turning our natural biological drives against us? Should we never eat really delicious food? No, but it may help to recognize the effects hyperpalatable foods can have on hijacking our appetites and undermining our bodies better judgment. We can also use some of those same primitive impulses to our advantage by monotonizing our choices of the bad and diversifying our choices of the good. In ""How Not to Diet"" I call it ""Meatball Monotony and Veggie Variety."" Try picking out a new fruit or vegetable every time you shop. In my own family\'s home, we always have a wide array of healthy snacks on hand to entice the finickiest of tastes. The contrasting collage of colors and shapes in fruit baskets and vegetable platters beat out boring bowls of a single fruit because they make you want to mix it up and try a little of each.

What do you think? A few big meals a day, or smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day, for weight management and optimal health? According to the best available science, it doesn’t seem to matter. “Overall current evidence does not suggest that manipulating eating frequency greatly benefits weight and health.” What we eat is more important than how often we eat it.

Should we be concerned that eating dried fruit may make us fat? Remember that fig study I covered, that added 14 figs to people’s daily diets? Surprisingly, that did not lead to significant weight gain. Wait a second. That’s 300 calories of figs a day. Over five weeks, that’s 10,000 calories. Did they disappear into thin air? No. Figs are so packed with fiber, and satiating, that even without trying, people just ended up eating less of other foods throughout the day. I get full just thinking about eating 14 figs a day. Was this just a fluke, though? Let’s look at those other new studies. What about adding three-quarters of a cup of dried apples to your diet, every day, for a year? 200 extra calories a day— but no significant change in weight. 200 extra calories of prunes a day, for a year? No significant change in weight. And, the same thing with a month of a daily 300-calorie load of dates. In general, the 5-10% of Americans that average a tablespoon or more of dried fruit a day tend to be less overweight, less obese, have a slimmer waist, and less abdominal obesity. They tended to eat more, but yet weighed less. Similar findings were found for those that eat nuts or nut butters— lower body mass index, and a slimmer waist. In past videos, I’ve explored the potential mechanisms, right? Nuts are filling, may boost metabolism, and may end up flushing some of their fat down the toilet. What if you put them both together? What would be the effect of adding daily fruit and nut bars on top of one’s regular diet, for two months? Took about a hundred folks who were overweight, randomized into two groups. Half ate their regular diet, and the other half ate their regular diet, plus two fruit and nut bars a day, totaling an extra 340 calories. But these weren’t candy calories; these were largely whole plant food calories— dried fruits and nuts. Two daily fruit and nut bars for two months did not cause weight gain. And, they had extra sugar in them. Maybe that’s why cholesterol didn’t get better, despite the nuts, which should have helped. “Recipes with…less sugar…might be expected to improve lipid profiles.” So, that’s brands, you know, like this.

What are some dietary strategies for the prevention and treatment of obesity? Large portion sizes are often targeted, and so restriction of portion size is an important element of many diet programs, but it’s hard to get people to eat less food. A more effective approach may be to shift the emphasis from the quantity of food eaten to the quality of the food eaten. By choosing foods with lower calorie density, we can eat the same amount of food, or even more food, while losing weight. Are there foods with negative calories, foods that take more energy to digest than they provide? Does eating celery, for example, result in negative energy balance? Celery is a readily available whole-food that has the ability to add bulk and flavor to a meal, without adding excess calories. It’s also subject to a renowned health myth, that when consuming celery there is a ‘negative’ intake of calories and therefore the energy required for its digestion, assimilation and nutrient storage is assumed to be greater than the energy it itself contains. So they put it to the test. A cup of celery— about two stalks— has 16 calories. To digest that much celery takes about 14 calories. So no, the consumption of celery does not induce a negative energy balance, but you are only left with two calories. This fact combined with the high fiber and water content of celery, does make it a good snack for inclusion in a diet for weight loss or management. Maybe negative calorie foods is not a myth after all, though. Researchers at Penn State offered people a meal of pasta, in which they could eat as much as they wanted. This is how many calories of pasta they ate. If in addition to the all-you-can-eat pasta meal they gave people a small salad, what do you think happened? Did those 50 extra calories of salad just end up on top of the pasta calories? No, they ended up eating less pasta over all, and not just 50 calories less pasta, 65 less calories, and by adding a bigger salad, ended up eating a 100 fewer calories. So effectively, the salad provided “negative calories.” They ate a salad on top  of what else they were eating. They ate more food and ended up with less calories in their system, because it bulked up their stomachs so much. Of course it depends what kind of salad. They’re not talking about your typical commercially available salads with like ranch dressing and cheese. You add those kinds of salad and you end up eating less pasta, but there are so many calories in conventional salads you end up worse off calorie-wise in the end. But healthy salads worked. They conclude: “eat less” is not always the best advice for foods very low in energy density, such as water-rich vegetables—like salad. Larger portions increase satiety, the feeling of fullness, and reduce meal calorie intake.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'In this live presentation, Dr. Greger offers a sneak peek into his book How Not to Diet.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

A calorie is not a calorie— it depends on what you eat. In this case, lowering fat content effectively made up to 100,000 calories, disappear. That’s why “Low in Added Fat”  is on my list of ideal weight loss ingredients as well. There are, however, two important exceptions. Processed foods with “reduced-fat claims” are often so packed with sugar that they can have the same number of calories as a higher fat product. SnackWell’s fat-free cookies, for example, at 1700 calories per pound are as calorie- dense as a cheese danish. The other exception to the low-fat rule is that vegetables are so calorically dilute that even a high-fat veggie dish, like some oily broccoli with garlic sauce, tends to be less calorie dense overall, which brings us to the second strategy for lowering calorie density: instead of sneaking out fat, sneak in vegetables. The biggest influence on calorie density is not fat, but water content. Since water adds weight and bulk without adding calories, the most calorie-dense foods and the most calorie-dense diets tend to be those that are dry. Some vegetables, on the other hand, are more than 95% water, and not just iceberg lettuce. Cucumbers, celery, turnips, cooked napa cabbage, bok choy, summer squash, zucchini, bean sprouts, and bamboo shoots can top out at 95% water. They’re basically just water in vegetable form. A big bowl of water-rich vegetables is practically just a big bowl of trapped water. The effect on calorie density is so dramatic the food industry wants in on the action. They figure they could use nanotechnology to “structure a solid processed food similar to a celery stalk with self-assembled, water-filled,… nanocells or nanotubes.” No need, as Mother Nature beat you to it. When dozens of common foods, pitted head-to-head for their ability to satiate appetites for hours, the characteristic most predictive was not how little fat or how much protein it had, but how much water it had. That was the number one predictor of how filling a food is. That’s why “High in Water- Rich Foods” is on my list, too. Water-rich foods like vegetables, topping the charts with most more than 90% water by weight, followed by most fresh fruit, coming in around the 80s. Starchier vegetables, whole grains, and canned beans are mostly 70s, meaning three- quarters of their weight: pure water. In general, when it comes to water- rich foods, most whole plant foods float towards the top, most animal foods fall somewhere in the middle, and most processed foods sink to the bottom. In a famous series of experiments, researchers at Penn State University decided to put water-rich vegetables to the test. Study subjects were served pasta and told to eat as much or as little as they’d like, and on average, they consumed about 900 calories of pasta. What do you think would happen if as a first course, you gave them a hundred calories of salad composed largely of lettuce, carrots, cucumber, celery, and cherry tomatoes? Would they go on to eat the same amount of pasta and end up with a thousand calorie lunch, 900 plus 100? Or would they eat maybe a hundred fewer calories of pasta, effectively canceling out the added salad calories? It was even better than that. They ate more than 200 fewer calories of pasta. Thanks to the salad, a hundred calories in, 200 calories out. So, in essence, the salad had negative 100 calories. Preloading with vegetables can effectively subtract a hundred calories out of a meal. That’s how you can lose weight by eating more food. Of course, the type of salad matters. The researchers repeated the experiment, this time adding a fatty dressing, extra shredded cheese, which quadrupled the salad’s calorie density. Now, eating this salad as a first course didn’t turn a 900-calorie meal into one with less than 800 calories. Instead, it turned it into a meal with calories in the quadruple digits. It’s like preloading pizza with garlic bread— you could end up with more calories overall. So, what’s the cut-off? Studies on preloading show that eating about a cup of food before a meal decreases subsequent intake by about 100 calories; so, to get a “negative calorie” effect, the first course would have to contain fewer than a hundred calories per cup. As you can see in the chart, this includes most fresh fruit and vegetables, but having something like a dinner roll wouldn’t work. But, hey, give people a large apple to eat before that same pasta meal, and rather than consuming two hundred calories less, it was more like three hundred calories less, so... how many calories does an apple have? It depends on when you eat it. Before a meal, an apple could effectively have about negative 200 calories. You can see the same thing giving people vegetable soup as a first course. Hundreds of calories disappear. One study tracked people’s intake throughout the day even found that overweight subjects randomized to pre-lunch vegetable soup not only ate less lunch, but deducted an extra bonus hundred calories at dinner, too, a whole seven hours later. So, the next time you sit down to a healthy soup, you can imagine calories being veritably sucked out of your body with every spoonful. Even just drinking two cups of water before a meal immediately caused people to cut about 20% of calories out of the meal, taking in more than 100 fewer calories. No wonder overweight men and women randomized to two cups of water before each meal lost weight 44% faster. Two cups of water before each meal, 44% faster weight loss. That’s why so-called “Negative Calorie Preloading” is on my list of weight loss boosters - which are  all the things I could find that can accelerate weight loss regardless of what you eat the rest of the time. Negative calorie preloading just means that starting a meal with foods containing less than a hundred calories per cup. That includes many fruits, vegetables, soups, salads, or simply, a tall glass of water. Anything we can put on that first-course salad to boost weight loss even further? In my “Amping AMPK” section I talk about ways to activate an enzyme known as the “fat controller.” Its discovery is considered one of the most important medical breakthroughs in the last few decades. You can activate this enzyme through exercise, fasting, and nicotine, but is there any way to boost it for weight loss without sweat, hunger, or the whole dying-a-horrible- death-from-lung-cancer thing? Well, Big Pharma is all over it. After all, obese individuals may be “unwilling to perform even a minimum of physical activity,” wrote a group of pharmacologists, “thus, indicating that drugs mimicking endurance exercise are highly desirable.” So, “it’s crucial that oral compounds with high bioavailability are developed to safely induce chronic AMPK activation” for “long-term weight loss and maintenance…” But, there’s no need to develop such a compound since you can already buy it at any grocery store. It's called... vinegar. When vinegar—acetic acid—is absorbed and metabolized, you get a natural AMPK boost. Enough of a boost to lose weight at the typical dose you might use dressing a salad? Vinegar has evidently been used to treat obesity for centuries, but only recently has it been… put to the test. Randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled trial on the effects of vinegar intake on the reduction of body fat in overweight men and women. The subjects were randomized to drink a daily beverage containing one or two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar or a controlled beverage developed to taste the same as the vinegar drink, but prepared with a different kind of acid so it didn’t have actual vinegar in it. Three months in, the fake vinegar group actually gained weight (as overweight people tend to do), whereas the genuine vinegar groups significantly lost body fat, as determined by CT scan. A little vinegar every day led to pounds of weight loss achieved for just pennies a day without removing anything from their diet. That’s why one of my 21 tweaks to accelerate weight loss is... two teaspoons of vinegar with each meal, either sprinkled on your salad or even just added to tea with some lemon juice. The beauty of the vinegar studies is that they were not just randomized, controlled trials, but placebo-controlled trials. Some studies aren’t controlled at all. Women asked to eat a ripe tomato before lunch every day for a month lost about two pounds, but without a control group you don’t know if the tomato had anything to do with it. Just being enrolled in a weight- loss study where you know they’re going to come back and weigh you in a month can have people change their diets in other ways. I mean it’s certainly possible. A tomato is 95% water; so, you’d be filling up a fist- sized portion of your stomach with only about fifteen calories before a meal, so it’s certainly possible, but we’d need a better study to prove it for weight loss. Stronger studies have control groups, at least, for example, randomize people to a weight-loss diet with or without one to two cups of low-sodium vegetable juice, and those drinking the vegetable juice lose significantly more weight. Or split people into two groups and give half about two tablespoons of goji berries a day, and forty-five days later, the goji group appeared to cut two-and- a-half inches off their waistline compared to no change in the control group. But any time you have one group do something special, you don’t know how much of the benefit is due to the placebo effect. In drug trials it’s easy: you give half the people the actual medication and the other half an identical- looking sugar pill placebo. Both groups are then doing the same thing—taking identical-looking pills— and so, if you see any difference in outcomes, we can suspect it’s the due to the actual drug. But what would placebo broccoli look like? That’s the problem.

We don't need a diet; we need a new way of eating that we can comfortably stick with throughout our lives.

So how\'s this for  a simple study— let\'s just analyze the  diets of 13,000 people and compare the nutrient  intake of those eating meat to the one of those eating  meat-free diets. They found that those  eating vegetarian were getting higher intakes  of nearly every nutrient, more fiber, more vitamin A,  more vitamin C, more vitamin E, more of the  B vitamins: thiamin, riboflavin, folate, more calcium, magnesium,  iron, and potassium, while at the same time eating  less of the harmful stuff like saturated fat and cholesterol. And yes, they got  enough protein. And some of those nutrients  are the ones Americans really struggle  to get enough of— fiber, vitamins A,C, and E,  calcium/magnesium/potassium and those eating vegetarian  got more of all of them. Even so, though, just because  they did better than the standard American diet  isn\'t saying much— they still didn\'t get as much  as they should have. I mean yes, those  eating vegetarian ate significantly more dark  green leafy vegetables, but that comes out to just  2 teaspoons of greens more. In terms of  weight management, the vegetarians were  consuming on average 363 fewer calories  every day. That\'s like what people do  when they go on a diet, and restrict their  food intake, but that seemed just like what  vegetarians ate normally, so a vegetarian diet  could be considered an all-you-care-to-eat version of a calorie-restricted  weight loss diet, naturally inducing  weight loss and also helping maintain healthy  weight status long term. So just following a  vegetarian diet alone, without focusing on calorie reduction, could result  in weight loss. How sustainable are more  plant-based diets long-term? They are in fact among  the ONLY type of diets that have been shown to  be sustainable long-term, perhaps because not only  do people lose weight but they often feel  so much better. And there\'s no calorie  counting or portion control. In fact, vegetarians may burn  more calories in their sleep! Those eating more  plant-based diets appear to have an 11% higher  resting metabolic rate. Both vegetarians and  vegans in this study just naturally seemed to have  a revved up metabolism compared to those  eating meat. Having said that, the vegetarian  diet pattern in this study included eating  eggs and dairy, so while they were  significantly slimmer than those  eating meat, they were still, on  average, overweight. As we\'ve seen before,  the only dietary pattern associated on average with  an IDEAL body weight was a strictly  plant-based one. Still, this study does  help dispel the myth that meat-free diets are  somehow nutrient deficient.

Raisins, like all fruits, have  a variety of health benefits,  but dried fruit is higher in  calories per serving than fresh,  so might they contribute to weight gain?  This study helped set people’s minds at ease.  Men and women assigned to consume  a cup of raisins a day for six weeks  evidently offset the consumption  of other foods in their diets  such that they experienced no significant  change in weight or waist circumference.  What about in kids? Leave it to the California Raisin Marketing  Board to dream up a study like this.  An after-school snack of raisins lowers  cumulative food intake in young children.  Sounds good, right?  But that’s compared to potato  chips and chocolate chip cookies.  They gave kids raisins,  grapes, chips, or cookies  and said they could eat as  much as they wanted and,  surprise, surprise: kids ate  less fruit and more junk,  but I guess naming the paper  “Kids Prefer Cookies”  would not have garnered  the same kind of marketing  board sponsor support. Reminds me of this study they did.  Regular consumption of raisins  may reduce blood sugar levels— compared to fudge cookies and Oreos.  Or how about this one:  raisins were found to cause  less of a blood sugar spike  than Coca Cola and candy bars.  Though you can tell it was not funded   by Big Raisin by their conclusion:  Whether the general public should  be advised to snack on fruit  rather than on candy bars requires  further debate and investigation.  Guess who funded that one? Comparing raisins to chips and  cookies was similarly unhelpful.  This is the study I was expecting.  Nine to eleven year old boys and girls  were told to eat all the grapes or raisins  they wanted 30 minutes before a meal in which  they could eat all the pizza they wanted.  If you just gave them the meal, no snack,   they ate 837 calories worth of pizza.  If you gave them all-you-can-eat grapes before  the meal, they ate 128 calories of grapes,  but that seemed to fill them up a bit   so they ended up eating less pizza.  But because they ate the snack and the meal,  they ended up getting more calories over all.  Still, grape calories are certainly better  than pizza calories, but check this out.  When given raisins instead, they  ate even more snack calories,  but the raisins were evidently  so satiating, so filling  that they ate so much less pizza  that they ate fewer calories over all.  Now I know as parents there’s a concern that if  our kids eat snacks it might spoil their dinner,  but when the snacks are fruit, and the  meal is a pepperoni and 3-cheese pizza,  the more we can ruin their appetite, the better.')]","Some healthy and filling snack options for someone trying to lose weight, based on Dr. Michael Greger's insights, include:

1. **Fruits**: Fruits like apples, pears, and oranges are low in calories and high in fiber and water content, making them very filling and ideal for weight management. They provide a significant amount of food volume without many calories, helping to reduce overall calorie intake.

2. **Vegetables**: Raw vegetables like carrots, celery, cucumbers, and cherry tomatoes are excellent snacks as they are very low in calories but high in fiber and water. These characteristics make them filling and help manage hunger.

3. **Boiled Potatoes**: Potatoes, particularly when boiled, are very satiating and can be more filling than other complex carbohydrates like rice and pasta. They have a low calorie density, which means they provide fewer calories for their weight, helping you feel full with fewer calories.

4. **Nuts**: Despite their high fat content, nuts are good for weight management as they are satiating and do not lead to the expected weight gain. They are nutrient-dense and help in feeling full.

5. **Salads**: Eating a low-calorie, vegetable-rich salad before meals can reduce overall calorie intake during the meal. It's important to use minimal high-calorie dressings to maintain the low energy density of the salad.

6. **Soups**: Vegetable-based soups are another excellent option as they are hydrating, filling, and low in calories. Having soup before a meal can lead to reduced calorie intake during the meal.

7. **Raisins and Other Dried Fruits**: While higher in calories than fresh fruits, raisins and other dried fruits can be part of a weight loss diet as they are satiating and tend to lead to reduced intake of other foods.

These snack options leverage the principle of energy density, where foods lower in calories but high in volume help control hunger and reduce overall calorie intake, facilitating weight loss.","Some healthy and filling snack options for someone trying to lose weight, based on Dr. Michael Greger's insights, include:

So how\'s this for  a simple study— let\'s just analyze the  diets of 13,000 people and compare the nutrient  intake of those eating meat to the one of those eating  meat-free diets. They found that those  eating vegetarian were getting higher intakes  of nearly every nutrient, more fiber, more vitamin A,  more vitamin C, more vitamin E, more of the  B vitamins: thiamin, riboflavin, folate, more calcium, magnesium,  iron, and potassium, while at the same time eating  less of the harmful stuff like saturated fat and cholesterol. And yes, they got  enough protein. And some of those nutrients  are the ones Americans really struggle  to get enough of— fiber, vitamins A,C, and E,  calcium/magnesium/potassium and those eating vegetarian  got more of all of them. Even so, though, just because  they did better than the standard American diet  isn\'t saying much— they still didn\'t get as much  as they should have. I mean yes, those  eating vegetarian ate significantly more dark  green leafy vegetables, but that comes out to just  2 teaspoons of greens more. In terms of  weight management, the vegetarians were  consuming on average 363 fewer calories  every day. That\'s like what people do  when they go on a diet, and restrict their  food intake, but that seemed just like what  vegetarians ate normally, so a vegetarian diet  could be considered an all-you-care-to-eat version of a calorie-restricted  weight loss diet, naturally inducing  weight loss and also helping maintain healthy  weight status long term. So just following a  vegetarian diet alone, without focusing on calorie reduction, could result  in weight loss. How sustainable are more  plant-based diets long-term? They are in fact among  the ONLY type of diets that have been shown to  be sustainable long-term, perhaps because not only  do people lose weight but they often feel  so much better. And there\'s no calorie  counting or portion control. In fact, vegetarians may burn  more calories in their sleep! Those eating more  plant-based diets appear to have an 11% higher  resting metabolic rate. Both vegetarians and  vegans in this study just naturally seemed to have  a revved up metabolism compared to those  eating meat. Having said that, the vegetarian  diet pattern in this study included eating  eggs and dairy, so while they were  significantly slimmer than those  eating meat, they were still, on  average, overweight. As we\'ve seen before,  the only dietary pattern associated on average with  an IDEAL body weight was a strictly  plant-based one. Still, this study does  help dispel the myth that meat-free diets are  somehow nutrient deficient. In fact, in response  the editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American  Dietetic Association asked, ""What could be more nutrient  dense than a vegetarian diet?""'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Who has the healthiest thoughts, attitudes, and habits regarding food?\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

At the turn of the century, if you would have asked teens why they chose to eat vegetarian, most might say they do it because they don\'t want to kill animals, followed by wanting to  eat a healthier diet. More recently, “to help the environment” became a leading reason among young people, followed by eating healthier and then animals. A smaller fraction gave weight loss as a reason. Yeah, they might think it’s healthier and care about animals and the environment, but they also might be doing it for weight loss reasons. Yes, we’re in the midst of an obesity epidemic, but there’s also been a rise in eating disorders. Might vegetarianism be a red flag for the presence of an eating disorder? A survey of adolescent and young adult vegetarians found they tended to eat better and have healthier body weights, but those who ate vegetarian were also more likely to report eating disorder-type behaviors. “It’s important, however,” commentators were quick to point out, “not to suggest that vegetarian diets cause eating disorders.” When people start eating more plant-based their risk for chronic diseases goes down, not up. Maybe it’s the children who have not yet adopted a vegetarian diet who require our special attention, “as they have poorer diets and are at significantly higher risk for obesity.” To which the authors responded, yes, they “agree that vegetarianism does not cause eating disorders”; they’re just saying that one should explore with them why they’re doing it. “While it’s important to recognize the potential health benefits, it is also important to investigate a teen’s motives for adopting a vegetarian diet.” See, “studies have shown that adolescents who have symptoms of eating disorders may [then go on to] adopt a vegetarian diet as a weight-loss method, as a socially acceptable way of avoiding eating.” So, rather than an increased prevalence of eating disorders among those who eat vegetarian, there may be an increased prevalence of vegetarianism among those with eating disorders. See, the study was just a snapshot in time; so, they couldn’t tell which came first. Might eating vegetarian just be a “way to disguise food restriction during the early stages of an eating disorder? Or, does experience with vegetarianism increase vulnerability for the development of eating disorders in the first place?” To answer the question, you need to know which came first, and… in most cases, eating vegetarian came at least a year after the first eating disorder symptoms. Similarly, in a series of anorexics, in fewer than 1 in 10 did meat avoidance predate the onset of their disease. It’s this kind of data that led the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics to conclude that “prior use of a vegetarian or vegan diet does not appear to increase the risk of an eating disorder.” In fact, they may have even lower dietary restraint scores. “Dietary restraint represents the conscious limitation of food intake,” the perception of constantly having to limit food intake to prevent weight gain. Perhaps the reason vegetarian women exhibited less restrained eating is because they really didn’t need to worry as much, because plant foods are just calorically less dense. “This could translate into less concern or stress when it comes to eating,” which may, in turn, help explain why they saw fewer ovulatory disturbances among women eating vegetarian. In fact, maybe that’s one of the reasons vegans report less stress and anxiety. Perhaps one of the reasons increasingly restricting animal foods is associated with better mood is that vegans reported dieting significantly less, and that’s one of the things that seems to be stressing women out. And vegans and true vegetarians didn’t just have significantly lower levels of restrained eating, but also less emotional eating, less compulsive eating, and greater levels of acceptance in relation to food. “This highlights previously unacknowledged positive aspects of adhering to a completely meat or animal product free diet” when it comes to thinking about food. Though, we don’t know if this actually translates into protection against developing disordered eating. “Vegans appear to have the healthiest attitudes towards food, closely followed by vegetarians.” But no one had actually taken a large sample of vegans and just put them through the EDE-Q, which is one of the most widely used diagnostic tools…until now. The first large sample of vegans to complete the official Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire and… vegans scored significantly lower, significantly better, consistent with the data showing vegans tended to diet less frequently. “Taken together, these findings suggest that vegans and omnivores don’t differ markedly in reported eating attitudes and behaviors, and when they do, vegans appear to endorse overall healthier thoughts and habits.”'), Document(metadata={'description': ""New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

So, this still doesn’t explain why vegetarians are so much slimmer, on average, than meat-eaters. Well, we’re getting closer to an answer. The reason I chose to major in biophysics, rather than biochemistry, is because of diagrams like this. This is the simplified version of human metabolism. The real deal is controlled by about 25,000 genes. Let me focus in on one in particular. This appears to be the enzyme that does much of the heavy lifting: carnitine palmitoyltransferase— CPT here— shovels the fat that we eat into the furnaces in our cells. The more active it is, the more fat we burn. That’s where a vegetarian diet seems to come in. Here’s our man CPT, significantly upregulated in vegetarians, boosted by about 60%.

Yeah, but we looked at nuts,  which are dense in calories and fat and they didn\'t appear to contribute to weight gain at all,  so let\'s not presume. Meat consumption and prospective weight gain in participants of the EPIC-PANACEA study.  What is that? Hundreds of thousands of men and women across 10 countries,  with weight gain measured over a 5 year period. What did they find? Total meat consumption was positively  associated with weight gain in men and women, in normal-weight and overweight subjects,  and in smokers and nonsmokers. Conclusion: Our results suggest that a decrease in meat consumption may  improve weight management. And this was after adjusting for initial weight, physical activity,  educational level, smoking status, total energy intake... Wait a second—what?! That\'s the kicker.  The link between meat and weight gain remained even after controlling for calories. One would assume that—sure—meat is associated with  weight gain because it\'s so packed with calories, and so you\'d just get more calories in your daily diet  compared to those eating vegetarian, and so more weight gain. But no—it\'s even more that that. This was AFTER  controlling for caloric intake, meaning if you have two people eating the same amount of calories— the person eating more meat may gain more weight. In fact, they even calculated how much more. An intake of 250g meat/day, like a steak, would lead  to an annual weight gain 422 g higher than the weight gain experienced with a same calorie diet with  lower meat intake. After 5 years, the weight gain would be about 5 pounds more. Same calories, yet  5 pounds more...eating meat. And steak was nothing. The strongest relationship with annual weight  change/weight gain...was observed for poultry. Let\'s say you start out normal weight and eat  a hamburger every day. This is how much extra weight beyond what\'s already in the calories you\'d put on  every year. What if, instead, you had the same amount of calories of processed meat, say a ham sandwich  with three deli slices of ham on it. You\'d gain this much extra. Whereas, just about a half a chicken breast  puts you up to here. Though the poultry effect was attenuated, evidently, if you remove people  who were previously sick or who lied about their diet. In conclusion, our results indicate that meat intake  is positively associated with weight gain and this association persisted after adjustment for total energy intake  and underlying dietary patterns. Our results are therefore in favor of the public health recommendation  to decrease meat consumption for health improvement.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'The most effective diet for weight loss may also be the healthiest.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Maybe it\'s because of the weight loss. Those eating more plant based tend to be significantly slimmer, and not just based on like looking at a cross-section of the population, but you can do interventional trials and put it to the test: a randomized, controlled community-based trial of a whole food plant-based diet. The key difference between plant-based nutrition and other approaches to weight loss is that participants were informed to eat the whole food plant-based diet ad libitum, meaning eat as much as you want, no calorie counting, no portion control. Just eat. It\'s about improving the quality of food rather than restricting the quantity of food. And then in this study, they had people just focus on diet rather than increasing exercise, just because they wanted to isolate out the effects of eating healthier. So, what happened? No restrictions on portions, eat all the healthy foods you want. Here\'s where they started out: on average obese at nearly 210 pounds; the average height was about 5\'5"". Three months in they were down about 18 pounds; 6 months in, more like 26 pounds down. But you know how these weight loss trials go. I mean, this wasn\'t an institutional study where they locked people up and fed them; no meals were provided. They just informed people about the benefits of plant-based eating and encouraged them to do it in their own lives, their own families, and their own homes and communities. And so, yeah, typically what you see in these so-called ""free-living"" studies is weight loss at six months, but then by a year the weight creeps back or even worse. But in this study, they were able to maintain that weight loss all year. And of course, their cholesterol got better too, but their claim to fame is that they achieved greater weight loss at 6 and 12 months than any other trial that does not limit calorie intake or mandate regular exercise. That\'s worth repeating. A whole food plant-based diet achieved the greatest weight loss ever recorded at 6 and 12 months compared to any other such intervention published in the medical literature. Now obviously with very low-calorie starvation diets you can drop people down to any weight. However, these medically supervised liquid diets are obviously just short-term fixes, associated with high costs, high attrition rates, and a high probability of regaining most of the weight, whereas the whole point of whole food plant-based nutrition is to maximize long-term health and longevity. I mean, even if, for example, low carb diets were as effective, the point of weight loss is not to fit into a skinnier casket. Studies on the effects of low-carbohydrate diets have shown higher rates of all-cause mortality— meaning a shorter lifespan— decreased artery function, worsening of coronary artery disease, and increased rates of constipation, headaches, bad breath, muscle cramps, general weakness and rash. And yet, still not as effective as the diet that actually has all the good side effects, like decreasing risk of diabetes, beyond just the weight loss. Yes, the lower risk of type 2 diabetes among vegetarians may be explained in part by improved weight status. However, the lower risk also may be explained by higher amounts of ingested dietary fiber and plant protein, the absence of meat- and egg-derived protein and heme iron, and lower intake of saturated fat. Most studies report the lowest risk of type 2 diabetes among those who adhere to strictly plant-based diets. This may be explained by the fact that vegans, in contrast to vegetarians, do not eat eggs, which appear to be linked to higher diabetes risk. Maybe it\'s eating lower on the food chain, so you avoid the highest levels of persistent organic pollutants like dioxins, PCBs, DDT in animal products, which have been implicated as a diabetes risk factor. Maybe it has to do with the gut microbiome. With all that fiber, no surprise that there\'d be less disease-causing bugs and more protective gut flora, which can lead to less inflammation throughout the body, that may be the key feature linking the heathier gut with beneficial health effects— including the metabolic dysfunction you can see in type 2 diabetes. And it\'s that multiplicity of benefits that can help with compliance and family buy-in. Whereas a household that includes people who do not have diabetes may be unlikely to enthusiastically follow a ""diabetic diet,"" a healthy diet is not disease-specific and can improve other chronic conditions too.

Maybe it\'s because of the weight loss. Those eating more plant based tend to be significantly slimmer, and not just based on like looking at a cross-section of the population, but you can do interventional trials and put it to the test: a randomized, controlled community-based trial of a whole food plant-based diet. The key difference between plant-based nutrition and other approaches to weight loss is that participants were informed to eat the whole food plant-based diet ad libitum, meaning eat as much as you want, no calorie counting, no portion control. Just eat. It\'s about improving the quality of food rather than restricting the quantity of food. And then in this study, they had people just focus on diet rather than increasing exercise, just because they wanted to isolate out the effects of eating healthier. So, what happened? No restrictions on portions, eat all the healthy foods you want. Here\'s where they started out: on average obese at nearly 210 pounds; the average height was about 5\'5"". Three months in they were down about 18 pounds; 6 months in, more like 26 pounds down. But you know how these weight loss trials go. I mean, this wasn\'t an institutional study where they locked people up and fed them; no meals were provided. They just informed people about the benefits of plant-based eating and encouraged them to do it in their own lives, their own families, and their own homes and communities. And so, yeah, typically what you see in these so-called ""free-living"" studies is weight loss at six months, but then by a year the weight creeps back or even worse.

Nutrition researchers have been desperate to uncover their secret. Yes, they tend to eat fewer calories— but not that many fewer. In the past, I’ve gone through a couple of theories that have emerged. Maybe it’s because people eating plant-strong diets express more of the fat-shoveling enzyme inside the power plants inside the mitochondria within their cells. Maybe it’s because they grow different populations of good bacteria in their gut. Maybe it’s because they’re avoiding the obesogenic, endocrine-disrupting industrial pollutants in the meat supply. An obesity-causing virus in poultry may even be contributing. We’re still not sure, but the theories keep coming. Here’s the latest. Maybe it’s the propionate? After all, what’s one of the things that’s only in plant foods, and never in animal foods? It’s fiber. Animals have bones to hold them up; plants have fiber to hold them up. I thought fiber was defined, though, by our inability to digest it. Sure, we can’t break it down, but the gazillions of good bacteria in our guts can. What do they make with it? Propionate, which gets absorbed into our bloodstream. So, technically we can digest fiber— but just not without a little help from our little friends. What does propionate do? Well, it inhibits cholesterol synthesis; that’s nice. It also appears to have a hypophagic effect— meaning it helps us eat less. Apparently, by slowing down the rate at which our food empties from our stomachs, thereby making us feel fuller, longer. Propionate may either regulate food intake, or the generation of new fat cells, resulting in an overall anti-obesity effect. One of the many ways fiber-containing foods— meaning whole plant foods— can help us control our weight.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Chicken consumption is associated with more weight gain than other meat.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Is it because they’re not eating meat  or because they’re eating more plants?  Or maybe they’re just eating fewer  calories or exercising more?  This study controlled for all that.  In essence, they took men and women who  ate the same number of calories a day,  ate the same amount of vegetables and fruit   and grains, same amount of exercise,  but ate different amounts of meat.  Men and women who ate less than a single serving  a day of meat were on average not overweight,  but the more meat they ate, the heavier they were,  and by one and a half servings a day, they  crossed the threshold – a BMI of 25 to  become officially classified as overweight.  Which type of meat was the worst?  If you remember back to that study of  hundreds of thousands of men and women,  poultry consumption appeared to be the  worst, but maybe it was reverse causation,  meaning obesity lead to greater chicken  consumption and not the other way around.  This new study controlled for that, adjusting  for dietary habits, yet found the same thing.  Chicken consumption was most associated  with weight gain in both women and men.

That’s like the way our gut flora communicates with us, dialing down our appetite, all the while increasing the rate at which we burn fat and boosting our metabolism at the same time. All thanks to fiber. Check this out. Put people on a brain scanner and show them a high-calorie food like a donut and the reward centers in their brains instantly light up. But, if you repeat the experiment, but this time, secretly deliver fiber-derived short-chain fatty acids directly into their colon, you get a blunted reward center response and subjects report that high-calorie foods just seemed less appetizing, and subsequently ate less of an all-you-can-eat meal. But fiber supplements like Metamucil don’t work, which makes sense because they're non fermentable, meaning our gut bacteria can’t eat them; so, yeah, they can improve bowel regularity, but can’t be used by our good bacteria to make those compounds that can block our cravings. For that, we have to actually eat real food. Our good gut bugs are trying to help us, but when we eat a diet deficient in fiber, we are in effect starving our microbial self. Less than 5% of Americans reach even the recommended minimum daily adequate intake of fiber, no surprise since the number one sources are beans and whole grains, and 96% of Americans don’t even reach the recommended minimum intake of legumes (which are beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils), and 99% don’t reach the recommended minimum for whole grains. Most people don’t even know what fiber is. More than half of Americans surveyed think that steak is a significant source of fiber. However, by definition, fiber is only found in plants. There is zero fiber in meat, eggs, or dairy, and typically little or no fiber in processed junk, and therein lies the problem. But wouldn’t at least the protein in that steak fill you up? Surprisingly, even a review supported by the meat, dairy, and egg industries acknowledged that protein intake does not actually translate into eating less later on, whereas you eat a fiber-rich whole grain for supper, and it can cut your calorie intake more than 12 hours later at lunch the next day! You feel full a hundred calories quicker the following day because by then, your good gut bugs are feasting on the same bounty and dialing down your appetite. Today, even our meat could be considered junk food. For more than a century, one of the great goals of animal agriculture has been to increase the carcass fat content of farm animals. Take chicken, for example. A hundred years ago, the USDA determined chicken was about 23% protein by weight and less than 2% fat. Today, chickens have been genetically manipulated through selective breeding to have about ten times more fat. Chicken Little has become Chicken Big and may be making us bigger too. Meat consumption in general is associated with weight gain, but poultry appeared to be the worst. Even just an ounce a day—which is like a single chicken nugget, or like one chicken breast every ten days, was associated with weight gain compared to eating no chicken at all. You know, it’s funny, when the meat industry funds obesity studies on chicken, they choose for their head-to-head comparison, foods like “cookies and sugar-coated chocolates.” This is a classic drug industry trick to try to make your product look better by comparing it to something worse. Apparently, just regular chocolate wasn’t enough to make chicken look better. But what happens when chicken is pitted against a real control, like chicken without the actual chicken? Chicken chickens out. Both soy-based proteins and Quorn, which is a plant-based meat made from the mushroom kingdom, were found to have stronger satiating qualities than chicken. Feed people a chicken and rice lunch, and four-and-a-half hours later, they eat 18% more of a dinner buffet than had they instead been given a chicken- free chicken and rice lunch. These findings are consistent with childhood obesity research that found that meat consumption seemed to double the odds of school children becoming overweight, compared to the consumption of plant-based meat products. Whole-food sources of plant protein such as beans did even better though, associated with cutting in half the odds of becoming overweight. So, that’s why I consider these kinds of plant-based meats more of a useful stepping stone towards a healthier diet, rather than the end-game goal/ideal. Part of the reason plant-based meats may be less fattening is they cause less of an insulin spike. A meat-free chicken like Quorn causes up to 41% less of an immediate insulin reaction. It turns out animal protein causes almost exactly as much insulin release as pure sugar. Just adding some egg whites to your diet can increase insulin output as much as a 60% within four days. And fish may be even worse. Why would adding tuna to mashed potatoes spike up insulin levels, but adding broccoli instead cut the insulin response by about 40%? It’s not the fiber, since giving the same amount of broccoli fiber alone provided no significant benefit. So, why does animal protein make things worse but plant protein makes things better? Plant proteins tend to be lower in the branched-chain amino acids which are associated with insulin resistance, the cause of type 2 diabetes. You can show this experimentally. Give some vegans branched-chain amino acids, and you can make them as insulin resistant as omnivores. Or, take some omnivores and put them even through a “48-hour vegan diet challenge,” and, within two days, you can see the opposite— there's a significant improvement in metabolic health. Why? Because decreased consumption of branched-chain amino acids improves metabolic health. Check this out. Those randomized to restrict their protein intake were averaging literally hundreds more calories a day; so, they should have become fatter right? But no, they actually lost more body fat. Restricting their protein enabled them to eat more calories, while at the same time they lost more weight. More calories, yet a loss in body fat. And this magic “protein restriction”? They were just having people eat the recommended amounts of protein. So, maybe they should have just called this group the normal protein group, or the recommended protein group, and the group that was eating more typical American protein levels and suffering because of it, the excess protein group. Given the metabolic harms of excess branched-chain amino acid exposure, leaders in the field have suggested the invention of drugs to block their absorption, to “promote metabolic health and treat diabetes and obesity without reducing caloric intake.” Or, we can just try not to eat so many branched-chain amino acids in the first place. They are found mostly in meat, including chicken and fish, dairy products, and eggs, perhaps explaining why animal protein is associated with higher diabetes risk, whereas plant protein appears protective. So, defining the appropriate upper limits of animal protein intake may offer a great chance for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and obesity, but it need not be all or nothing. Even an intermittent vegan diet has been shown to be beneficial. If there was one piece of advice that sums up the recommendations in my upcoming book it would be: “Wall Off Your Calories.” Animal cells are encased only in easily digestible membranes, which allows the enzymes in our gut to effortlessly liberate the calories in a steak, for example. Plant cells, on the other hand, have cell walls that are made out of fiber, which present an indigestible physical barrier; so, many of the calories remain trapped. Now, processed plant foods, however, fruit juice, sugar, refined grains, even whole grains if they have been powdered into flour, have had their cellular structure destroyed, their cell walls cracked open and their calories are free for the taking. But when you eat structurally intact plant foods, chew all you want— you’re still going to end up with calories completely surrounded by fiber, which then blunts the glycemic impact, activates the ileal brake, and delivers sustenance to your friendly flora. So, bottom line, try to make sure as many of your calories as possible— your protein, your carbs, your fat— are encased in cell walls, in other words from whole, intact plant foods. That’s what nature intended to happen. Millions of years before we learned how to sharpen spears and mill grains and boil sugar cane, our entire physiology is presumed to have evolved in the context of eating what the rest of our great ape cousins eat: plants. The Paleolithic period, when we started using tools, only goes back about two million years. We and the great apes have been evolving since back in the Miocene era, more like twenty million years ago. So, for the first 90% of our hominoid existence, our bodies evolved on mostly plants. It’s no wonder then that our bodies may thrive best on the diet we were designed to eat. So, maybe we should go back to our roots. [clears throat] With enough portion control, anyone can lose weight. Lock someone in a closet, and you can force them to lose as much body fat as you want. Chaining someone to a treadmill could probably have a similar effect. But what is the most effective weight-loss regimen that doesn’t involve calorie restriction or exercise—or a felony? I scoured through the medical literature and all the randomized controlled trials, and the single most successful strategy to date is a diet of whole plant foods. The single most effective weight loss intervention like that ever published in the peer-reviewed medical literature, a whole food, plant-based diet. That works better than anything else studied to date. And, no wonder given what we just learned about fiber and branched-chain amino acids. We’ve known for more than forty years that those eating predominantly plant-based diets weigh, on average, about thirty pounds less than the general population, but you don’t know if it’s the""), Document(metadata={'description': 'In this live presentation, Dr. Greger offers a sneak peek into his book How Not to Diet.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

That’s like the way our gut flora communicates with us, dialing down our appetite, all the while increasing the rate at which we burn fat and boosting our metabolism at the same time. All thanks to fiber. Check this out. Put people on a brain scanner and show them a high-calorie food like a donut and the reward centers in their brains instantly light up. But, if you repeat the experiment, but this time, secretly deliver fiber-derived short-chain fatty acids directly into their colon, you get a blunted reward center response and subjects report that high-calorie foods just seemed less appetizing, and subsequently ate less of an all-you-can-eat meal. But fiber supplements like Metamucil don’t work, which makes sense because they're non fermentable, meaning our gut bacteria can’t eat them; so, yeah, they can improve bowel regularity, but can’t be used by our good bacteria to make those compounds that can block our cravings. For that, we have to actually eat real food. Our good gut bugs are trying to help us, but when we eat a diet deficient in fiber, we are in effect starving our microbial self. Less than 5% of Americans reach even the recommended minimum daily adequate intake of fiber, no surprise since the number one sources are beans and whole grains, and 96% of Americans don’t even reach the recommended minimum intake of legumes (which are beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils), and 99% don’t reach the recommended minimum for whole grains. Most people don’t even know what fiber is. More than half of Americans surveyed think that steak is a significant source of fiber. However, by definition, fiber is only found in plants. There is zero fiber in meat, eggs, or dairy, and typically little or no fiber in processed junk, and therein lies the problem. But wouldn’t at least the protein in that steak fill you up? Surprisingly, even a review supported by the meat, dairy, and egg industries acknowledged that protein intake does not actually translate into eating less later on, whereas you eat a fiber-rich whole grain for supper, and it can cut your calorie intake more than 12 hours later at lunch the next day! You feel full a hundred calories quicker the following day because by then, your good gut bugs are feasting on the same bounty and dialing down your appetite. Today, even our meat could be considered junk food. For more than a century, one of the great goals of animal agriculture has been to increase the carcass fat content of farm animals. Take chicken, for example. A hundred years ago, the USDA determined chicken was about 23% protein by weight and less than 2% fat. Today, chickens have been genetically manipulated through selective breeding to have about ten times more fat. Chicken Little has become Chicken Big and may be making us bigger too. Meat consumption in general is associated with weight gain, but poultry appeared to be the worst. Even just an ounce a day—which is like a single chicken nugget, or like one chicken breast every ten days, was associated with weight gain compared to eating no chicken at all. You know, it’s funny, when the meat industry funds obesity studies on chicken, they choose for their head-to-head comparison, foods like “cookies and sugar-coated chocolates.” This is a classic drug industry trick to try to make your product look better by comparing it to something worse. Apparently, just regular chocolate wasn’t enough to make chicken look better. But what happens when chicken is pitted against a real control, like chicken without the actual chicken? Chicken chickens out. Both soy-based proteins and Quorn, which is a plant-based meat made from the mushroom kingdom, were found to have stronger satiating qualities than chicken. Feed people a chicken and rice lunch, and four-and-a-half hours later, they eat 18% more of a dinner buffet than had they instead been given a chicken- free chicken and rice lunch. These findings are consistent with childhood obesity research that found that meat consumption seemed to double the odds of school children becoming overweight, compared to the consumption of plant-based meat products. Whole-food sources of plant protein such as beans did even better though, associated with cutting in half the odds of becoming overweight. So, that’s why I consider these kinds of plant-based meats more of a useful stepping stone towards a healthier diet, rather than the end-game goal/ideal. Part of the reason plant-based meats may be less fattening is they cause less of an insulin spike. A meat-free chicken like Quorn causes up to 41% less of an immediate insulin reaction. It turns out animal protein causes almost exactly as much insulin release as pure sugar. Just adding some egg whites to your diet can increase insulin output as much as a 60% within four days. And fish may be even worse. Why would adding tuna to mashed potatoes spike up insulin levels, but adding broccoli instead cut the insulin response by about 40%? It’s not the fiber, since giving the same amount of broccoli fiber alone provided no significant benefit. So, why does animal protein make things worse but plant protein makes things better? Plant proteins tend to be lower in the branched-chain amino acids which are associated with insulin resistance, the cause of type 2 diabetes. You can show this experimentally. Give some vegans branched-chain amino acids, and you can make them as insulin resistant as omnivores. Or, take some omnivores and put them even through a “48-hour vegan diet challenge,” and, within two days, you can see the opposite— there's a significant improvement in metabolic health. Why? Because decreased consumption of branched-chain amino acids improves metabolic health. Check this out. Those randomized to restrict their protein intake were averaging literally hundreds more calories a day; so, they should have become fatter right? But no, they actually lost more body fat. Restricting their protein enabled them to eat more calories, while at the same time they lost more weight. More calories, yet a loss in body fat. And this magic “protein restriction”? They were just having people eat the recommended amounts of protein. So, maybe they should have just called this group the normal protein group, or the recommended protein group, and the group that was eating more typical American protein levels and suffering because of it, the excess protein group. Given the metabolic harms of excess branched-chain amino acid exposure, leaders in the field have suggested the invention of drugs to block their absorption, to “promote metabolic health and treat diabetes and obesity without reducing caloric intake.” Or, we can just try not to eat so many branched-chain amino acids in the first place. They are found mostly in meat, including chicken and fish, dairy products, and eggs, perhaps explaining why animal protein is associated with higher diabetes risk, whereas plant protein appears protective. So, defining the appropriate upper limits of animal protein intake may offer a great chance for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and obesity, but it need not be all or nothing. Even an intermittent vegan diet has been shown to be beneficial. If there was one piece of advice that sums up the recommendations in my upcoming book it would be: “Wall Off Your Calories.” Animal cells are encased only in easily digestible membranes, which allows the enzymes in our gut to effortlessly liberate the calories in a steak, for example. Plant cells, on the other hand, have cell walls that are made out of fiber, which present an indigestible physical barrier; so, many of the calories remain trapped. Now, processed plant foods, however, fruit juice, sugar, refined grains, even whole grains if they have been powdered into flour, have had their cellular structure destroyed, their cell walls cracked open and their calories are free for the taking. But when you eat structurally intact plant foods, chew all you want— you’re still going to end up with calories completely surrounded by fiber, which then blunts the glycemic impact, activates the ileal brake, and delivers sustenance to your friendly flora. So, bottom line, try to make sure as many of your calories as possible— your protein, your carbs, your fat— are encased in cell walls, in other words from whole, intact plant foods. That’s what nature intended to happen. Millions of years before we learned how to sharpen spears and mill grains and boil sugar cane, our entire physiology is presumed to have evolved in the context of eating what the rest of our great ape cousins eat: plants. The Paleolithic period, when we started using tools, only goes back about two million years. We and the great apes have been evolving since back in the Miocene era, more like twenty million years ago. So, for the first 90% of our hominoid existence, our bodies evolved on mostly plants. It’s no wonder then that our bodies may thrive best on the diet we were designed to eat. So, maybe we should go back to our roots. [clears throat] With enough portion control, anyone can lose weight. Lock someone in a closet, and you can force them to lose as much body fat as you want. Chaining someone to a treadmill could probably have a similar effect. But what is the most effective weight-loss regimen that doesn’t involve calorie restriction or exercise—or a felony? I scoured through the medical literature and all the randomized controlled trials, and the single most successful strategy to date is a diet of whole plant foods. The single most effective weight loss intervention like that ever published in the peer-reviewed medical literature, a whole food, plant-based diet. That works better than anything else studied to date. And, no wonder given what we just learned about fiber and branched-chain amino acids. We’ve known for more than forty years that those eating predominantly plant-based diets weigh, on average, about thirty pounds less than the general population, but you don’t know if it’s the"")]","There are several factors that might contribute to weight gain even on a vegetarian diet:

1. **Caloric Intake**: Even though vegetarian diets are generally lower in calories, it's still possible to consume more calories than the body needs. High-calorie vegetarian foods like cheeses, nuts, oils, and processed snacks can contribute to weight gain if consumed in large amounts.

2. **Nutrient Density and Food Choices**: A vegetarian diet that includes a lot of processed foods, sugary beverages, and high-fat dairy products might lead to weight gain. It's crucial to focus on nutrient-dense, whole plant foods like fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains rather than highly processed vegetarian options.

3. **Portion Sizes**: Large portions of even healthy foods can contribute to excessive calorie intake.

4. **Metabolic Factors**: Individual metabolic rates and how one's body processes foods can also play a role. For example, the document mentions that vegetarians might have an 11% higher resting metabolic rate, but this can vary widely between individuals.

5. **Physical Activity**: Lack of sufficient physical activity can contribute to weight gain, regardless of diet type.

6. **Psychological Factors**: Sometimes, people might compensate for restricting certain foods (like meat) by overeating other foods, leading to higher calorie intake.

It's important to focus on a balanced diet rich in whole foods, manage portion sizes, and ensure adequate physical activity. If weight gain persists, it might be helpful to consult with a healthcare provider or a dietitian to review the diet in detail and address individual specific needs or metabolic issues.","There are several factors that might contribute to weight gain even on a vegetarian diet:

Michael Greger live from my treadmill here to answer any and all questions you may have I did a facebook live earlier today and doing YouTube now will do this every month for those who come from others my work every year I read through every issue of every English language nutrition journal in the world some busy folks like you don't have to I think follow most interesting most groundbreaking most practical findings into new videos novels upload everyday to my website nutritionfacts.org everything on the website is free there are no ads no commercial uh no corporate sponsorship strictly non-commercial not selling anything just put it up as a public service as a labor of love as a tribute to my grandmother who is the reason that I went into medicine and practice lifestyle medicine to this day let me start at the top and I will go through the questions and hopefully get to yours Paulo a so many health concerns associated with drinking water from plastic bottles I guess there are if you look at there are both microbiological concerns as well as chemical concerns so for example from polycarbonate plastic if you search on nutrition of Exxon org for the word for the letters BPA my you will see my videos about some of these plastics chemicals also on phthalates start spelled with a P P th ala tes my check out those or just type in plastics or plastic into nutrition facts that are a little search bar all my videos will come up um and you can enjoy lance ass how do I prevent water intoxication if I don't salt my foods um if um so hyponatremia is you can actually wash out the electrolytes in your system if you um exercise intensely sweat a lot and or just drinking pure water the concern was that wait a second don't have to add salt to my food as if for millions of years of evolution we had salt shakers sitting there um no need to add salt food um but we should but if you are excessively exercising you need to replete your electrolytes that's the whole kind of gatorade thing you can do it a lot healthier than just drinking sugar water by eating actual food like fruit um and so we should get all our sodium from natural sources not from salsa come not from processed foods you do not have to take a bag of potato chips on your bike rides ah seabird asks I am requesting an option to see Spanish subtitles absolutely in fact we have Spanish subtitles on hundreds of videos people don't realize that if you do a search for videos on nutrition of X or um there's language options you can say I just want to see the ones with Polish subtitles or Russian subtitles or you know the Italian subtitles amen Spanish is actually our most common one we've got hundreds of videos already translated we have a whole team of translation volunteers you actually can be one of those if you'd like to help out we're actually going to convert the entire site into Spanish so not just the subtitles for all the videos but like all the wording on the site so it would be like a little flag you know you go to some websites and it's like you can choose your language um well it's going to be same thing nutrition facts outdoor where you can see in English when you see the entire site in Spanish um and then we're going to move to other languages to broaden the number of people that can have access to this life-changing life-saving information but right now you can access those Spanish subtitles by just doing a search on nutrition facts at work and then clicking the spanish-language buttons all right Laura asked coumadin I've been diagnosed ah with a thrombus a clot warfare every day to maintain a 9r they're vegetarians does guarantee bristled without anticoagulants absolutely not you need anti if you have excessively clotting blood for whatever reason or if you have a heart valve or any kind of internal hardware that could cause your blood to clot although there is there are there's basically what's called salicylic acid which is kind of the active ingredient in aspirin found in plant foods not just in willow bark or as originally harvested from UM and so people eating plant-based diets particularly the spicy plant-based that's just a lot of salicylates in spices like cumin ma you will have blood levels of aspirin on which rival that of people actually taking a baby aspirin a small dose aspirin pill every day even though you're not on aspirin you have the same aspirin doses of your body that may actually been be beneficial in terms of reducing not only heart disease risk a stroke risk certain types of stroke risk as well as cancer risk and I've got a bunch of videos coming up on aspirin and cancer but that's not your blood would not be thin enough to prevent clots if you have some excessive clotting disorder and so if your physician wants you on coumadin then you need to to remain on coumadin as long and just make sure that you they titrate the greens consumption you dark green leafy vegetable consumption the mountain community does basically cumin is a vitamin k poison and so on if you eat a lot of vitamin K you need up your dose to keep them in line alright okay Lance okay um Lance is just making some comments that's good okay I'm gonna keep going down um um I don't know how to pronounce a Jo a with a little thing on it Oh I'm sorry I said he has an exam with 289 people on grams per milliliter of b12 as at a healthy level ma you assuming those the units I'm familiar with um yes that would be fine but you still would want to take the question is should continue to take vitamin b12 of course you should a 2500 microns once a week of cyanic of elements probably all you or anyone should need I mean you say well wait a second more fine levels are fine well they won't be fine for long if you don't get a regular reliable source of vitamin b12 um Sarah read an article from a nutrigenomics company saying that your genes determine whether or not animal or plant base to make 3s are good for you all mega 3s are originally plant-based and are then created by animals such as yourselves when you eat them there may be polymorphisms but which means kind of gene variations in mod Delta 60 saturates enzymes the elongation enzymes but and so one may want to take a preformed long-chain omega-3 fatty acid supplement I've got a bunch of videos new videos about that so check it out a vitamin Lindsay says what do I think about intermittent fasting I've got a bunch of videos on intermittent fasting coming up I keep saying that but I do and it's actually a really complex topic um and but I will be talking about all the variations of intermittent fast and water-only fasting the timing duration meals all sorts of good stuff it's all coming out um it's not that I'm trying to keep anything from you I just haven't read all the science yet there's tremendous load hundreds of new articles um and so I want to make sure I have a sense of where they're going just doing kind of a light reading but I wanted to a deep dive before I before I synthesize all the available science alright Michael good name s if you take a DHA EPA supplement how much ala should get every day as it's still important to keep in to make a six to make a three ratio 4 to 1 um so um if you're already getting prima so the reason one wants to keep their ratio relatively low makes 16 mega threes is to kind of facilitate your body's elongation stretching omega-3s found in flax seeds and walnuts not into the long-chain versions um but also G still need to do that if you're taking um you know and and you need to get a source of of of ala like flex seeds or walnuts or hemp nuts or chia seeds if you're already taking that and my answer is yes to both but not for the reason one might think so I mean what's the recommendation to about make six ratio it stay away from junky vegetables like Cornell safflower oil sunflower oil concealed oil so you'd still want to do that regardless for all sorts of reasons and why so do you not have to take flax seeds now if you're getting a preformed source of of DHA will make you three something only reason we eat a super healthy foods like black seeds and walnuts they have other health problem in compounds for example flax seeds have these anti-cancer lignin compounds which you know you would be missing out on so it's still stick with my daily doesn't recommend actually get a tablespoon of ground flax seeds every day for the other health benefits priscila talked about BPA at the beginning ah ma soeur know are there plant foods that reverse postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and small fiber neuropathy um I do not know of any um but if you do a PubMed search so if you go PubMed gov govt um that's the database National Library of Medicine or just medical library in the world and you type in whatever grow that you're interested in and the word diet or foods or such and Stace come up um I'd be have it look at them send them my way I will dig them up and if there's something interesting useful for others I will make a video about it and share with others alright Steve what foods would I recommend for a toddler to have on a daily basis Oh like a daily dozen toddler version that's a good idea I should come up with that um until I do though I would encourage you to check out wonderful sources like anything Brenda Davis is written or read mangles has written they both done wonderful books and chapters on feeding healthy diets to infants and small children um Cristina named assessing research on diet macular degeneration very certain there is I just haven't looked at it yet I haven't got to my latest I folder um studies I could actually look at it now but it would take some time but if there is I realize that's an issue that a lot of people deal with and we'll definitely do any videos on any new exciting developments in that area David asks what foods increased stamina and energy I need more than a caffeine jolt um well um the question is I mean you should

One of them is amla — dried Indian gooseberries. Now, not only is it more powerful, but also more palatable. You could add a whole teaspoon of amla to a smoothie, and probably wouldn’t even taste it. Try doing that with a teaspoon of powdered cloves. One sip; you’d be on the floor! Let’s look at the antioxidant content of some typical American breakfast foods: bacon [7] and eggs [+8], for example. A bowl of corn flakes [25] with milk [+9]. Egg McMuffin [16]. Pancakes [16] with maple syrup [+9]. Bagel [24] with cream cheese [+2]. Compare those to the smoothie I had this morning. A cup of unsweetened soymilk [16], a half a cup of frozen blueberries [+535]. Whoa! Alright? Already, I’ve got to shrink the scale way down. The pulp of a nice ripe Mexican mango [+124]. Note the mango alone has more antioxidants than the other breakfasts. A tablespoon of ground flax seeds, and my previous secret ingredient, a palmful of bulk white tea leaves [+101] — just throw them in there and blend them in. Now, that used to be my breakfast smoothie, but now, a teaspoon of that gooseberry powder [+782], and we’re off the charts again. Look at it. That’s about four cents’ worth of amla — four pennies — and look what it does to my smoothie. 1,500 units of antioxidant power, and I haven’t even fully woken up yet! Way more than the five other meals combined. In fact, more than the average person gets in an entire week. I could drink my smoothie and eat nothing but donuts the rest of the week, and most people still wouldn’t catch up.

Is it better to exercise in the morning or the evening? Before breakfast or after breakfast? There was a Nobel Prize- winning exercise physiologist who said he always ran a mile every morning before breakfast. Was he right? Let’s find out. More than a dozen experiments have been published comparing the amount of fat burned in a fasted versus fed state, and every single one found more fat was burned on an empty stomach. On average, a single bout of low- to-moderate intensity activity before a meal burned off three grams more fat than the same amount of exercise after a meal. That’s about three-quarters of a pat of butter’s worth of fat, enough to improve insulin sensitivity. The same amount of exercise, but more fat loss, all because of timing. Now, just because you burn more fat while you’re exercising doesn’t necessarily mean you end up  with less fat at the end of the day. Maybe your body offsets the extra fat loss that occurs during exercise with a little extra fat storage when you finally do eat, balancing it out. Researchers in Japan set out to investigate the possibility that your body makes up for it later by measuring 24-hour fat balance after 100 minutes of running either before breakfast or after lunch. On the exercise-after-lunch day, they burned a total of 608 calories of fat over the course of that day. In contrast, on the exercise- before-breakfast days, in the same 24-hour period they burned through nearly 90 percent more, 1,142 calories of straight fat. So, the next day, they woke up with about a quarter cup of fat less after the same amount of exercise. That’s remarkable! What about just something like walking? Sixty minutes before breakfast, after lunch, or after dinner. Over the 24 hours  they exercised in the evening, 432 calories were burned off. On the afternoon exercise day, they burned off 446 calories of fat. They also had a control day with no exercise at all, and on that day, they burned through 456 fat calories. That’s disappointing—it’s like they never walked at all. But the same amount of exercise before breakfast resulted in 717 calories of fat loss. Over the course of a day timing matters, so much so that when it comes to an hour of walking, exercise increases 24-hour fat burning only when it is performed before breakfast. Here’s the fat balance graph with no exercise. You can see the fat storage bump up at breakfast, lunch, and supper, before slowly coming back down overnight. Exercise in the afternoon or evening and end up with more fat than not exercising at all, but exercise in the morning and at least your fat balance comes back to baseline. All such similar studies on both men and women show we burn through more fat on the days we exercise before, rather than after eating. After reading the chronobiology chapter though or watching my chronobiology videos, an alternative explanation may spring to mind. Maybe it’s just a morning thing. Maybe it has nothing to do with meals, and your circadian rhythm is just dictating the difference. No. Exercising in the morning after breakfast appears no better than exercising in the evening after dinner, and exercising before breakfast works better than immediately after breakfast, both still in the morning. It really does seem to be a pre- versus post-meal effect. But why? Carbohydrate is the preferred fuel of the body. When you eat sugars or starches, they get broken down and converted into blood sugar. After a meal, blood sugars rise and your muscles are quick to snatch it up for fuel without having to rely much on your energy stores. If you instead take a siesta, and your muscles have no immediate need for energy, the excess blood sugar from a meal can be stored in our muscles in the form of glycogen for later use. Glycogen is just a bunch of blood sugar molecules strung together into a mass of branches that can be broken off and used for quick bursts of energy any time we need them. If you exercise after a meal, your muscles can siphon off some of the extra blood sugar floating around for energy. Before a meal, your muscles have to instead resort to dipping into your energy stores and end up burning mostly a combination of glycogen and fat. That explains why you burn more fat during fasted exercise, but what about all the extra fat burned throughout the rest of the day? Glycogen is more than a store. Glycogen isn’t just an energy reserve, but acts as a sensor capable of activating metabolic pathways. Exercising before breakfast can exhaust as much as 18 percent of your glycogen stores, and that depletion can act as a powerful rallying cry to your fatty tissues to start pulling more of their own weight by breaking down more fat. The lower glycogen stores fall, the greater the sustained 24-hour fat loss. How long do you have to go without food in order to trigger this effect? Six hours may be sufficient; so, it doesn’t have to be before breakfast. If you timed it right, you could exercise before a late lunch, or if you have an early enough lunch, maybe before dinner when you get home from work. If exercise in a fasted state isn’t possible, does it matter what you eat? Insulin release after a meal appears to play a critical role in suppressing fat breakdown, explaining why lower glycemic foods— in this case, muesli versus cornflakes— can have less of an effect. Lentils were identified as a promising option for maintaining athletic endurance (which can take a hit on an empty stomach) while maintaining more of the fat dissolution. Lentils are said to be unlikely to be consumed by the general population due to \'low palatability"". They obviously haven’t tried my mom’s lentil soup. It\'s worth mentioning that although there’s increased 24-hour fat burning exercising in a fasted state, the only way to see if this facilitates weight loss over time is to put it to the test, which we’ll explore next.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Every month I go live from my treadmill to answer your questions here on YouTube and on Facebook.

Pritikin Ornish and Esselstyn I've got a lot of videos about that um and so gonti says that grantees eating vegan but of course vegan doesn't mean healthy vegan can be coca-cola and potato chips and you know god knows what and so encourage you to sent your dad around whole plant foods um and also of course mono a cluster I was doing else or other things and suggestions for getting fat soluble

air breathed air so you shouldn't breathe air what I mean yeah but normal you know non villainous people also breathe air like it doesn't make a lot of sense anyway I'm not saying sugars good for you I think we should cut out all that in the sugars from the dead okay maple flava is back I'm saying do I use a wire to still have no Martin distiller seems to me to I waste of energy resilient H tasks

thing is a healthy diet period and exercise actually can improve load if we're talking about depression means I'm trying to think if I have stuff on saffron let me see saffron lavender and you just got a type of mental illness whatever particular mental illness you're interested in and nutrition facts are to pull up all the foods now I encourage you to just I mean you just make things with you know make Paia with your saffron I'm sure you could take it in capsules as a supplement if you really wanted to um Rebecca asked can it should a Crohn's a patient take probiotics and a multivitamin Crohn's patients should eat healthfully I have not reviewed the probiotics Crohn's Liz you're in a while but I think of something really phenomenal that popped up I would have heard about it and I mean dependent I mean if you're a Crohn's patient that has much of your intestine removed and you might run into Vitamin kind of absorption issues but that be something you talk to you or physician about in terms of what parts your intestine and intestinal tract have been removed and then talk about what particular nutrient deficiencies you might run into certainly see a lot of problem with that with people getting these kind of gastric bypass operations running into serious nutrient deficiencies but if you have your entire gut then you should be able to get all your nutrients from the produce aisle with the exception of vitamin b12 and vitamin T all right Jesse Byrne tick sorry if I'm mispronouncing everybody's names ah says I always put my questions on YouTube every month in advance and they never show up well it just did and so if this was a question instead of saying them I would answer it anyway Leanne a yes I came across something called alkaloid build-up um and it

should I trust the added vitamins b12 etc in my daily great value bran flakes oh can you rely on them as it's being really there like if it says that it must be twelve um should you trust your brand Flake manufacturer well ideally we probably should be eating bran flakes I mean presumably I mean most cold cereals with very few exceptions are pretty bad for you they have a lot of it sugar at its salt there's a few exceptions like Uncle Sam cereal basically has like I think two ingredients right rolled whole wheat berries and like flax seeds but but anything processed like that it's just not a very healthy food but in terms of does it actually have the vitamins that it that it says probably although vitamin b12 was so critically important for people eating plant-based diets I wouldn't necessarily rely on rely on their word for it um Adam a wants to play asks any videos about the benefits of being in nature oh cool Japanese first bathing you know I've never heard about that I'm even know how I ran across it probably because I put in maybe if I put in like green leafy vegetables or something and they caught the word green pubmed and anyway there's this very interesting body of literature about the purported health benefits of being in nature now of course you can imagine all the co-founders who's in nature people actually have to kind of walk into nature so this exercise then there's like fresh air there's sunshine so is being in nature actually good for you beyond just all those other things like if you walked on a treadmill and had fresh air and sunshine would it be the same as being surrounded by forests so they do these studies where they're I put people in front of a TV screen and they show you before oh you lots of green but you're actually not in a forest maybe there's some like you know you know pine needle compounds in the air that are beneficial anyway you can imagine how difficult those kind of studies are but there have been a couple well-designed studies I'm actually gonna do a series of videos on that very topic stay to Rebecca and not Vieira asks when you have your appendix taken out should you change your diet at all um well you should vastly improve your diet as appendicitis is is kind of a consequence of eating a measurable Western low fiber diet so something like appendicitis is rare among population centers their diets are not whole plant food so that's probably just you should take that as a sign that you haven't mean enough flavor containing foods predominately beans and old grains and so you should bump it up a notch TJ a Cassandra G oh I think somebody TJ is responding to X is on dry Maria um vs a my concern about studies showing it about hormones instead of showing up in tap water from people flushing prescription medications actually sometimes it's actually not just flushing it just gets excreted unchanged in the urine so they're just taking the medications than peeing the medication straight into the water supply mom and so I said video about that I'm talking about they you know how much prozac builds up in fish flush because of all the stuff that's dumped into Waterways so check out that video she probably searched for Prozac I think prozac doing the UM drugs it should pop right up maybe prozac in water all right Maria V asks what do you eat drink for energy to beat the afternoon slump my

If you hook yourself up to an IV and just drip sugar water into your vein at a steady pace throughout the day, at about 8 pm your blood sugars start to go up, even though you haven\'t eaten anything, and the infusion rate didn\'t change. The same amount of sugar is going into your system every minute, but your ability to handle it deteriorates in the evening, but bounces right back in the morning. A meal eaten at 8 pm can cause twice the blood sugar response as an identical meal eaten at 8 am. It\'s as if you ate twice as much! Your body just isn\'t expecting you to be eating when it\'s dark outside. Our species may have only discovered how to use fire about a quarter million years ago. We just weren\'t built for 24-hour diners. One of the tests for diabetes is called the glucose tolerance test to see how fast your body can clear sugar from your bloodstream. You swig down a cup of water with about four and a half tablespoons of regular corn syrup mixed in, and then have your blood sugar measured two hours later. By that point your blood sugar should be under 140 mg/dL. Between 140 and 199 is considered prediabetes, and 200 and up is a sign of full-blown diabetes. The circadian rhythm of glucose tolerance is so powerful that a person can test normal in the morning but as a prediabetic later in the day. Prediabetics who average 163 at 7 am, test out as frank diabetics by 7 pm at over 200. Choosing lower glycemic foods may help promote weight loss, but timing is critical. Due to this circadian pattern of glucose tolerance, a low glycemic food at night can cause a higher blood sugar spike than a high glycemic food eaten in the morning. We\'re so metabolically crippled at night, researchers found that eating a bowl of All Bran at 8 pm caused as high a blood sugar spike as eating Rice Krispies at 8 am. High glycemic foods at night would seem to be the worst of both worlds. So, if you\'re going to eat refined grains and sugary junk, it might be less detrimental in the morning. The drop in glucose tolerance over the day could therefore help explain the weight loss benefits of frontloading calories towards the beginning of the day. Even just an earlier versus later lunch may make a difference. People randomized to eat a large lunch at 4:30 pm suffered a 46% greater blood sugar response compared to the identical meal eaten just a few hours earlier at 1 pm. And a meal at 7 am can cause 37% lower blood sugars than an identical meal at 1 pm. Now there doesn\'t seem to be any difference between a meal at 8 pm and the same meal at midnight; they both seem to be too late. But eating that late, at midnight, or even 11 pm can so disrupt your circadian rhythm that it can mess up your metabolism the next morning, resulting in significantly higher blood sugars after breakfast, compared to eating the same supper at 6 pm the evening before. So these revelations of chronobiology bring the breakfast debate full circle. Breakfast skipping not only generally fails to cause weight loss but worsens overall daily blood sugar control in both diabetic and nondiabetic individuals. See how the breakfast skippers have higher blood sugars even while they\'re sleeping 20 hours later? That may help explain why those who skip breakfast appear to be at higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the first place. Breakfast skippers also tend to have higher rates of heart disease and atherosclerosis in general. Is it just because breakfast skipping tends to cluster with other unhealthy choices, such as smoking and sicklier eating habits overall? The link between breakfast skipping and heart disease—even premature death in general—seems to survive attempts to control for these confounding factors. But you don\'t know until you put it to the test. Does skipping breakfast lead to higher cholesterol, for example? Yes, a significant rise in LDL, bad cholesterol, in those randomized to skip breakfast, about 10 points higher within just two weeks. The Israeli 700/500/200 study found that the triglycerides of the king-prince-pauper group got significantly better— a 60-point drop—while those on the pauper-prince-king group got significantly worse, a 26-point rise. So, consuming more calories in the morning relative to the evening may actually have a triple benefit: more weight loss, better blood sugar control, and lower heart disease risk. So if you\'re going to skip any meal, whether practicing intermittent fasting or time-restricted feeding, where you try to fit all your food into a certain daily time window, it would be safer and more effective perhaps to skip dinner rather than breakfast.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Why are calories eaten in the morning less fattening than calories eaten in the evening?\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

One reason is that more calories are burned off in the morning due to diet-induced thermogenesis. That’s the amount of energy the body takes to digest and process a meal, given off in part as waste heat. If you take people and give them the exact same meal in the morning, afternoon, and night, their body uses up about 25% more calories to process it in the afternoon than night and about 50% more calories to digest it in the morning. That leaves fewer net calories in the morning to be stored as fat. Let’s put some actual numbers to it. A group of Italian researchers randomized 20 people to eat the same standardized meal at 8 a.m. or 8 p.m., and then a week later had them all come back to do the opposite. So, each person had a chance to eat the same meal for breakfast and for dinner. After each meal, the subjects were placed in a “calorimeter” contraption to precisely measure how many calories they were burning over the next three hours. The researchers calculated that the meal given in the morning took about 300 calories to digest, whereas the same meal given at night used up only about 200 calories to process. The meal was about 1200 calories, but given in the morning it ended up only providing about 900 calories compared to more like 1000 calories at night. Same meal, same food, same amount of food, but effectively 100 fewer calories. So, a calorie is not just a calorie. It depends on when we eat them. Why do we burn more calories eating a morning meal— is it behavioral or biological? If you started working the graveyard shift, sleeping during the day and working all night, which meal would net you fewer calories? Would it be the “breakfast” you had at night before you went to work, or the “supper” you had in the morning before you went to bed? In other words, is it something about eating before you go to sleep that causes your body to hold on to more calories, or is it built into our circadian rhythm, where we store more calories at night regardless of what we’re doing? You don’t know, until ... you put it to the test. Harvard researchers randomized people to identical meals at 8 a.m. vs. 8 p.m. while under simulated night shifts or day shifts. And regardless of activity level or sleeping cycle, the calories burned processing the morning meals were 50% higher than in the evening. So, the difference is explained by chronobiology; it’s just part of our circadian rhythms to burn more meal calories in the morning. But why? What exactly is going on? How does it make sense for our body to waste calories in the morning when we have the whole day ahead of us? Our body isn’t so much wasting calories as investing them. When we eat in the morning our body bulks up our muscles with glycogen, which is the primary energy reserve our body uses to fuel our muscles. But this takes energy. In the evening, our body expects to be sleeping for much of the next 12 hours, so rather than storing blood sugar as extra glycogen in our muscles, it preferentially uses it as an energy source, which may end up meaning we burn less of our backup fuel which is body fat. In the morning, however, our body expects to be running around all day, so instead of just burning off breakfast, our body continues to dip into our fat stores while we use breakfast calories to stuff our muscles full of the energy reserves we need to move around over the course of the day. That’s where the “inefficiency” may come from. The reason it costs more calories to process a morning meal is because instead of just burning glucose (blood sugar) directly, our bodies are instead using up energy to string glucose molecules together into chains of glycogen in our muscles, which are then just going to be broken back down into glucose later in the day. That extra assembly/disassembly  step takes energy— energy that your body takes out of your meal, leaving you with fewer calories. So, in the morning our muscles are especially sensitive to insulin, rapidly pulling blood sugar out of our bloodstream to build up glycogen reserves. At night, though, our muscles become relatively insulin resistant. Our muscles resist the signal to take in extra blood sugar. So, does that mean you get a higher blood sugar and insulin spike in the evening compared to eating the exact same meal in the morning? Yes. In that 100-calorie difference study, for example, blood sugars rose twice as high after the 8 pm meal compared to same meal in the morning. So, shifting the bulk of our calorie intake towards the morning would appear to have a dual benefit— more weight loss, and better blood sugar control.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Michael Greger coming to you live from my treadmill like I do every month to answer any questions you may have this year I'm excited to answer your question in person in book signing lines in Q&A is 200 cities lined up although I've only got like 190 to go or something been on the road for a couple of weeks in Southern California in Arizona but hopefully we'll be in your town soon including countries like Poland and Denmark and Iceland for the first time ever I'm really excited in Denmark is crazy they had to open a whole bed like an 800 person theater they had to do a second thing because they sold out so quickly they're doing a whole second showing I guess I'm gonna do two back-to-back that is just so coolest place I've ever even been so I just I think speaks to the tremendous surge in interest in healthy eating so that's super exciting so that's the best part is seeing everybody of course all the travel and bad food and bad sleep is not the best part but I'll be done 10 months and off to write the next book how not to age anyway for those who are unfamiliar to every year I redo every issue of every English ladies nutrition journal the world so busy folks like you don't have to I think upon combined all the most interesting most groundbreaking most practical families and the new videos and articles upload every day nearly every day to my number I would say nutritionfacts.org everything on the website is what free there are no ads no corporate sponsorship strictly non-commercial not saw anything just put it up as a public service as a labor of love as a tribute to my grandmother new videos an article said free day nearly every day and latest an evidence-based nutrition what a concept alright let's start with your questions what's so nice about Facebook log as opposed to YouTube no YouTube I supposed to Facebook live is the questions don't move like you're putting your questions down and I just go in order I don't have to skip it and cuz it scroll up too quickly but um so let's do it number one Steve Parker why eliminate nutritional yeast I'm sorry if you've got that impression so on Facebook someone with hid retinitis support Eva says what should I cut out of my diet I said nutrition 'is there are two groups of individuals that should not eat nutritional yeast well three I guess one if you have an allergy which I've never heard of but on to is if you have had United subroutine v''e which is autoimmune condition as well as Crohn's disease why I've got videos on that just type in nutritionist and check it all out but for everybody else just say is perfectly fine and I had some for breakfast actually all right Carl Carl yeah Carl Cramer says any advice for loose skin and post big weight loss first of all congratulations on the big weight loss you will off so much weight you have loose skin that is a phenomenal feat keep up the good work but unfortunately the only thing new there are only surgical interventions in terms of cosmetic surgery to get rid of the excess flaps of skin and for everybody else not gain that much weight in the first place my synergy dance Dan CO or synergy dance acts how are the majority of longest-living people in blue zones doing so well despite eating meat fish dairy occasionally you just answered your own question because they only eat meat fish dairy occasionally so for example the Okinawan Japanese the second longest living population in the world of course this is when they weren't eating KFC like they are now they actually have some of the worst public health statistics now but in the 50s when they're reading how their more traditional diets they had like a 97% plant-based diet and so and really have that kind of a sweet potato vegetable based diet um the only people live longer than them only formerly study population is the seven day Adventists vegetarians Loma Linda California I just spoken love Linda that was a lot of fun and and they don't eat any meat at all and they're the only blue zone that actually like continues to be a blue zone right now these other these are historical examples they now westernized their diet so but the blue zone that is doing the best and continues to thrive is the one that doesn't eat any meat at all and living about a decade longer and general population Richard Strauss says what's the optimal dose is your vitamin E per day well dosage implies you're taking vitamin supplement want to do actually there's a study suggesting that those taking vitamin E supplements actually cut their lives short but you do need vitamin E but you should get it from natural sources like that's in seeds um why do Oh possible possibly right says why do we avoid mr. Solis I didn't say that I only said if you have Crohn's disease and or hidradenitis suppurativa everybody else feel free to eat your nutrition yeast in fact it's a way to get your vitamin b12 if it's fortified with b12 oh speaking of b12 ApS is duckweed a safe plant source for b12 and the answer is not until it's proven to be right I mean that's critically important all right vitamin b12 so the company that makes it or that packaged it that sells it purports on to show active b12 that is improvement until people with b12 deficiency are a given duckweed is a sole source and their b12 level recovers right there home assistant comes down if they're fully replete or they're methylmalonic acid level drops it's the only way right um so there's a lot of tests for b12 that don't necessarily show active b12 there are b12 analogs cause your body can't use fools our body actually they're like connect as anti b12 so you just do not want to mess around you can end up paralyzed demented or dead from a b12 deficiency so until it's proven to be a reliable source where they actually do a clinical study you could it's easy to find vegans low in b12 right because so many vegans are too stupid to not to to not supplement they are stupid for not supplementing and um so you put pretend of them twenty of them and give them some duckweed and see what happens and until then it's not a reliable source of b12 until it's proven to be a reliable source of b12 because it's not something you want to mess around with all right critically important all right and look even if they claimed that there's a bacteria that kind of lives in the duckweed that produce would be 12 let's say they do the study and they show that a batch of duckweed improves their their veto status okay that's great so you can you say that that batch of duckweed improves to be 12 it doesn't mean all duckweed or all the duckweed they even sell has active b12 maybe it has different bacteria that aren't making b12 at the moment so unless they can show reliably that whatever species of duckweed they have just always makes b12 that's always usable by people if that's not the case then you need to stick with supplements a vitamin b12 or vitamin b12 fortified foods okay Emily Paige Peron or posh a Peron says hi what you take on gluten flour homemade note well no salt say 1000 obviously so not a whole food but it's a green yellow or green light food um so it's a yellow light food it's the process plant food so it's a platform from which something bad good has been taken away or something bad has been added and here's this case nothing bad has been added but there has been something good taken away right you you know how to make seitan you wash away the fiber wash away some nutrition but but in terms of meat substitutes certainly better then you know everything else in the market right which has added sodium often added saturated fat of course what would be even better meets us to real whole food like legumes whole grains mushrooms these kind of things okay anyway tattooed woman asked please talk about nano volley pig in assists and how hard it is for the Oh for the body it turned carbohydrate into fat so tattooed women did not mean men denovo leap in Genesis she meant that de novo epigenesis so your body so it's true that if you over feed people calories it's easier to make people gain weight giving people fat calories in carbohydrate calories in fact you can make 100,000 College disappear by effective feeding people trying to over feed people carbohydrates opposed to fat I talked about this study but in long Vermont prisoners where they tried this experimental weight gain say they tried to get people to gain weight took one hundred thousand more calories on a mixed diet then then all fat died but but the problem it so but if you like you drink all ones if you drink a couple liters of soda a day even though you won't make a lot of fat you know where that fat is made that fat is made in your liver increases liver fat which is can dull the sensitivity to insulin in your liver and set you up for all sorts of badness so so yeah do not overeat my added sugars so yeah okay so even if it doesn't you're like oh it just puts a few grams of fat on your body huh yeah because where it is liver fat that's a bad thing increase your risk of fat liver disease again bad thing okay the chosen comment asks someone working in hospitals working for on for office it possible is it difficult to it is difficult to intermittent task I'm not eating the middle of night any recommendations I don't eat the middle of the night I mean that's there's not much you can do I mean there's all sorts of clonal biological badness that comes along with night shifts I'm like the light in the middle of the night that's not good but you can't do much about that but you can do something about eating so you don't eat it you still don't either die on you eat before you go to before you go to bed and in the morning or before you go to - - to work and in terms of well I'm gonna get so hungry going on that without food well you need to you know eat your thylakoids you

And the physical form of food not only alters fat absorption, but carbohydrate absorption as well. For example, rolled oats have a significantly lower glycemic index than instant oatmeal, which is just oats but in thinner flakes. And oat flakes cause lower blood sugar and insulin spikes than powdered oats. Same single ingredient, oats, but in different forms can have different effects. Why do we care? Well, the overly rapid absorption of carbohydrates after eating a high-glycemic index meal can trigger “a sequence of hormonal and metabolic changes” that may promote excessive eating. They took a dozen obese teen boys and fed them different meals, each with the same number of calories, and just followed them for the next five hours to measure their subsequent food intake. And those that got the instant oatmeal went on to eat 53 percent more than after eating the same number of calories of steel-cut oatmeal. The instant oatmeal group was snacking within an hour after the meal and goes on to accumulate significantly more calories throughout the rest of the day. Same food, but different form, different effect. Instant oatmeal isn’t as bad as some breakfast cereals, though, which can get up into the 80s or 90s, even a cereal with zero sugar like shredded wheat. The new industrial methods used to create breakfast cereals such as extrusion cooking and explosive puffing accelerate starch digestion and absorption, causing an exaggerated blood sugar response, added sugar or not. Shredded wheat has the same ingredients as spaghetti— just wheat—but has twice the glycemic index. When you eat spaghetti, you get a gentle rise in blood sugars. If you eat the exact same ingredients made into bread form, though, all the little bubbles in bread allow your body to break it down quicker; so, you get a big spike in blood sugars, which causes our body to over-react with an exaggerated insulin spike. And that actually ends up driving our blood sugars below fasting levels, and that can trigger hunger. Experimentally, if you infuse someone with insulin so their blood sugars dip, you can cause their hunger to spike and, in particular, hunger cravings for high-calorie foods. In short, lower-glycemic index foods may help one feel fuller longer than equivalent higher glycemic index foods. Researchers randomized individuals into one of three breakfast conditions: oatmeal made from quick oats, the same number of calories of Frosted Flakes, or just plain water, and then measured how much people ate for lunch three hours later. Not only did those who ate the oatmeal feel significantly fuller and less hungry… they indeed then went on to eat significantly less lunch. Overweight participants ate less than half as many calories at lunch after eating the oatmeal for breakfast, hundreds and hundreds of calories less. In fact, if you notice, the breakfast cereal was so unsatiating that the Corn Flakes group ate as much as the breakfast-skipping water-only group. It’s as if the cereal group hadn’t eaten breakfast at all! Feed people Honey Nut Cheerios, and hours later they feel significantly less full, less satisfied, and more hungry than those fed the same number of calories of oatmeal. Though both breakfasts were oat-based, the higher glycemic index, reduced intact starch, and reduced intact fiber in the Cheerios seemed to have all conspired to diminish appetite control. The trial was funded by the Pepsi Corporation, makers of the Quaker oatmeal, pitted against the Cheerios from rival General Mills. And an exposé on industry-funded study manipulation later revealed that the study originally included another arm, Quaker Oatmeal Squares. “I am sorry that the oat squares did not perform as well as hoped,” the researcher told Pepsi, which decided to publish only the results about its oatmeal.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'The remarkable impact of the structure of food beyond nutritional content or composition.\n\nIn case you missed my previous cereal video, check out The Worst Food for Tooth Decay (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-worst-food-for-tooth-decay).

But who eats just one meal a day? What about just shifting our daily distribution of calories earlier in the day? Israeli researchers randomized overweight and obese women into one of two “isocaloric” groups, meaning each group was given the same number of total calories. One group was given a 700-calorie breakfast, a 500-calorie lunch, and a 200-calorie dinner; and the other group was given the opposite, 200 for breakfast, 500 for lunch, and 700 for dinner. Since they were all eating the same number of calories overall, the king-prince-pauper group should have lost the same amount of weight as the pauper- prince-king group, right? But no, the morning-slanted group lost more than twice as much weight, in addition to slimming about an extra two inches off their waistlines. By the end of the 12-week study, the king-prince-pauper group lost 11 more pounds (19 pounds lost compared to 8 despite eating the same number of calories). That’s the power of chronobiology, the power of our circadian rhythm. … 700, 500, 200 is 50% of calories at breakfast, 36% of calories at lunch, and only 14% of calories at supper. That’s pretty skewed. What about 20% for supper instead, a 50%-30%-20% spread, compared to 20-30-50? Again, the bigger breakfast group experienced “dramatically increased” weight loss, about nine pounds different in just eight weeks with no significant differences in overall calorie intake or physical activity between the two groups. Instead of 80%+ of calories at breakfast and lunch, what about 70% compared to 55%? Overweight “homemakers” were randomized to eat 70% of their calories at breakfast, a morning snack, and lunch, leaving 30% for an afternoon snack and dinner, or a more balanced 55% up through and including lunch. In both cases only a minority of calories were eaten for dinner. Would it matter if it was just 55% up through lunch or 70%? Yes, significantly more weight loss and slimming in the dietary pattern that was even more biased towards the morning. “Stories about food and nutrition are in the news on an almost daily basis, but information can sometimes be confusing and contradictory. Clear messages should be proposed in order to reach the greatest number of people,” the researchers conclude. And one clear communication physicians could give is “If you want to lose weight, eat more in the morning than in the evening.” Even just telling people to eat their main meal at lunch rather than dinner may help. Despite comparable calorie intakes, participants in a weight loss program randomized to get advice to make their main meal lunch, beat out those who instead were told to make their main meal dinner. The proverb “Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper” evidently has another variant: “Eat breakfast yourself, share lunch with a friend, and give dinner away to your enemy.” I wouldn’t go that far, but there does appear to be metabolic benefit to front loading the bulk of your calories earlier in the day. The evidence isn’t completely consistent, though. A review of dietary pattern studies questioned the role that reducing evening intakes would facilitate weight loss, citing this study that showed the evening-weighted group did better than the heavy morning meal group. Perhaps that was because the morning meal group was given for breakfast “chocolate, cookies, cake, ice cream, chocolate mousse and donuts.” So, chronobiology can be trumped by a junk food methodology. Overall, the “what” is still more important than the “when.” Caloric timing may be used to accelerate weight loss but doesn’t substitute for a healthy diet. When he said there was a time for every purpose under heaven, Ecclesiastes probably wasn’t talking about donuts.')]","To stay energized for early morning hikes, it's important to focus on foods that provide sustained energy. Here are some ideal options based on Dr. Michael Greger's insights:

1. **Oatmeal**: Starting your day with oatmeal is excellent as it has a low glycemic index and provides long-lasting energy. Oatmeal is rich in complex carbohydrates that break down slowly, keeping your blood sugar levels stable and providing a steady source of energy. Consider adding a tablespoon of ground flaxseeds for added fiber and omega-3 fatty acids, which Dr. Greger recommends for their health benefits.

2. **Fruits**: Incorporating fruits like bananas or apples can offer quick, natural sugars and a boost of fiber. Bananas are particularly beneficial as they provide potassium, which helps maintain nerve and muscle function during your hike.

3. **Nuts and Seeds**: Almonds, walnuts, or chia seeds are great for hikes. They are packed with healthy fats and protein that can help sustain your energy levels. Dr. Greger highlights the importance of nuts in a healthy diet, noting their role in providing essential nutrients.

4. **Whole Grain Toast**: Pairing whole grain toast with nut butter provides a good mix of complex carbohydrates and protein, ensuring sustained energy release. This combination helps prevent spikes in blood sugar, providing more consistent energy levels.

5. **Hydration**: While not a food, staying hydrated is crucial for maintaining energy during hikes. Dr. Greger emphasizes the importance of hydration for overall health and energy levels. Consider starting your day with a large glass of water and carrying enough water during your hike.

These foods align with Dr. Greger’s recommendations for a plant-based diet that emphasizes whole foods for optimal health and energy.","To stay energized for early morning hikes, it's important to focus on foods that provide sustained energy.

Studies dating back to the 30s found that by hooking athletes on a treadmill up to an IV drip of sugar water, you could delay fatigue, and that drinking sugar water could help as well. So, the sports supplement industry has come up with an array of energy drinks, shots, gels, bars, chews— even sports jelly beans, used (what a coincidence!), by the Jelly Belly Cycling Team. In fact, the Jelly Belly Candy Company paid for a study that found that said sports jellybeans could shave four or five seconds off of a 10K cycling trial, compared to sports drinks or gels. But, what about compared to raisins? Given that “professional, collegiate, and recreational sporting events are supplement centered and heavily marketed to, athletes at all levels may be left with the impression that ‘specially designed’ supplements are essential for optimal performance. Yet, these products are often expensive and cheaper, natural foods that may provide a healthier alternative are often overlooked. There are low-cost, natural food products rich in [carbs], such as sun-dried raisins… that have the potential to improve performance to a similar degree. [R]aisins are nutritious, convenient, typically palatable, and are a cost-effective source of [concentrated carbohydrates].” But, do they work as well? They work exactly as well. Exact same time. Same thing comparing raisins to a commercial sports gel— same respiratory exchange, same carb and fat oxidation, same energy expenditure. In fact, the only significant difference between raisins and jelly beans was in “hedonic scores”— pleasantness scoring— and, raisins beat out the jelly beans. Compared to jelly beans with flavors like “Extreme Watermelon,” there was a greater preference for just raisin-flavored raisins.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Every month I go live from my treadmill to answer your questions here on YouTube and on Facebook.

Crohn's patients should eat healthfully I have not reviewed the probiotics Crohn's Liz you're in a while but I think of something really phenomenal that popped up I would have heard about it and I mean dependent I mean if you're a Crohn's patient that has much of your intestine removed and you might run into Vitamin kind of absorption issues but that be something you talk to you or physician about in terms of what parts your intestine and intestinal tract have been removed and then talk about what particular nutrient deficiencies you might run into certainly see a lot of problem with that with people getting these kind of gastric bypass operations running into serious nutrient deficiencies but if you have your entire gut then you should be able to get all your nutrients from the produce aisle with the exception of vitamin b12 and vitamin T all right Jesse Byrne tick sorry if I'm mispronouncing everybody's names ah says I always put my questions on YouTube every month in

should I trust the added vitamins b12 etc in my daily great value bran flakes oh can you rely on them as it's being really there like if it says that it must be twelve um should you trust your brand Flake manufacturer well ideally we probably should be eating bran flakes I mean presumably I mean most cold cereals with very few exceptions are pretty bad for you they have a lot of it sugar at its salt there's a few exceptions like Uncle Sam cereal basically has like I think two ingredients right rolled whole wheat berries and like flax seeds but but anything processed like that it's just not a very healthy food but in terms of does it actually have the vitamins that it that it says probably although vitamin b12 was so critically important for people eating plant-based diets I wouldn't necessarily rely on rely on their word for it um Adam a wants to play asks any videos about the benefits of being in nature oh cool Japanese first bathing you know I've never heard about that I'm even know how I ran across it probably because I put in maybe if I put in like green leafy vegetables or something and they caught the word green pubmed and anyway there's this very interesting body of literature about the purported health benefits of being in nature now of course you can imagine all the co-founders who's in nature people actually have to kind of walk into nature so this exercise then there's like fresh air there's sunshine so is being in nature actually good for you beyond just all those other things like if you walked on a treadmill and had fresh air and sunshine would it be the same as being surrounded by forests so they do these studies where they're I put people in front of a TV screen and they show you before oh you lots of green but you're actually not in a forest maybe there's some like you know you know pine needle compounds in the air that are beneficial anyway you can imagine how difficult those kind of studies are but there have been a couple well-designed studies I'm actually gonna do a series of videos on that very topic stay to Rebecca and not Vieira asks when you have your appendix taken out should you change your diet at all um well you should vastly improve your diet as appendicitis is is kind of a consequence of eating a measurable Western low fiber diet so something like appendicitis is rare among population centers their diets are not whole plant food so that's probably just you should take that as a sign that you haven't mean enough flavor containing foods predominately beans and old grains and so you should bump it up a notch TJ a Cassandra G oh I think somebody TJ is responding to X is on dry Maria um vs a my concern about studies showing it about hormones instead of showing up in tap water from people flushing prescription medications actually sometimes it's actually not just flushing it just gets excreted unchanged in the urine so they're just taking the medications than peeing the medication straight into the water supply mom and so I said video about that I'm talking about they you know how much prozac builds up in fish flush because of all the stuff that's dumped into Waterways so check out that video she

To snack or not to snack? A review was recently published on the accumulated research about eating frequency, and both weight and health. Maybe we should eat throughout the day, to reduce hunger, increase our metabolic rate, mobilize our body fat. Or, maybe, snacking will just lead us to overeat. What does the science say? What do you think? A few big meals a day, or smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day, for weight management and optimal health? According to the best available science, it doesn’t seem to matter. “Overall current evidence does not suggest that manipulating eating frequency greatly benefits weight and health.” What we eat is more important than how often we eat it. If you do like snacking, though, a new study, thanks to the California Prune Board, suggests that (what else?) prunes may be a particularly good choice, given the “satiating power of prunes”— which they found, like with nuts, to compensate for the majority of their calories.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""The California Raisin Marketing Board need not have funded such misleading studies given the healthfulness of their product.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Raisins, like all fruits, have  a variety of health benefits,  but dried fruit is higher in  calories per serving than fresh,  so might they contribute to weight gain?  This study helped set people’s minds at ease.  Men and women assigned to consume  a cup of raisins a day for six weeks  evidently offset the consumption  of other foods in their diets  such that they experienced no significant  change in weight or waist circumference.  What about in kids? Leave it to the California Raisin Marketing  Board to dream up a study like this.  An after-school snack of raisins lowers  cumulative food intake in young children.  Sounds good, right?  But that’s compared to potato  chips and chocolate chip cookies.  They gave kids raisins,  grapes, chips, or cookies  and said they could eat as  much as they wanted and,  surprise, surprise: kids ate  less fruit and more junk,  but I guess naming the paper  “Kids Prefer Cookies”  would not have garnered  the same kind of marketing  board sponsor support. Reminds me of this study they did.  Regular consumption of raisins  may reduce blood sugar levels— compared to fudge cookies and Oreos.  Or how about this one:  raisins were found to cause  less of a blood sugar spike  than Coca Cola and candy bars.  Though you can tell it was not funded   by Big Raisin by their conclusion:  Whether the general public should  be advised to snack on fruit  rather than on candy bars requires  further debate and investigation.  Guess who funded that one? Comparing raisins to chips and  cookies was similarly unhelpful.  This is the study I was expecting.  Nine to eleven year old boys and girls  were told to eat all the grapes or raisins  they wanted 30 minutes before a meal in which  they could eat all the pizza they wanted.  If you just gave them the meal, no snack,   they ate 837 calories worth of pizza.  If you gave them all-you-can-eat grapes before  the meal, they ate 128 calories of grapes,  but that seemed to fill them up a bit   so they ended up eating less pizza.  But because they ate the snack and the meal,  they ended up getting more calories over all.  Still, grape calories are certainly better  than pizza calories, but check this out.  When given raisins instead, they  ate even more snack calories,  but the raisins were evidently  so satiating, so filling  that they ate so much less pizza  that they ate fewer calories over all.  Now I know as parents there’s a concern that if  our kids eat snacks it might spoil their dinner,  but when the snacks are fruit, and the  meal is a pepperoni and 3-cheese pizza,  the more we can ruin their appetite, the better.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Every month I go live from my treadmill to answer your questions here on YouTube and on Facebook.

this day let me start at the top and I will go through the questions and hopefully get to yours Paulo a so many health concerns associated with drinking water from plastic bottles I guess there are if you look at there are both microbiological concerns as well as chemical concerns so for example from polycarbonate plastic if you search on nutrition of Exxon org for the word for the letters BPA my you will see my videos about some of these plastics chemicals also on phthalates start spelled with a P P th ala tes my check out those or just type in plastics or plastic into nutrition facts that are a little search bar all my videos will come up um and you can enjoy lance ass how do I prevent water intoxication if I don't salt my foods um if um so hyponatremia is you can actually wash out the electrolytes in your system if you um exercise intensely sweat a lot and or just drinking pure water the concern was that wait a second don't have to add salt to my food as if for millions of years of evolution we had salt shakers sitting there um no need to add salt food um but we should but if you are excessively exercising you need to replete your electrolytes that's the whole kind of gatorade thing you can do it a lot healthier than just drinking sugar water by eating actual food like fruit um and so we should get all our sodium from natural sources not from salsa come not from processed

videos people don't realize that if you do a search for videos on nutrition of X or um there's language options you can say I just want to see the ones with Polish subtitles or Russian subtitles or you know the Italian subtitles amen Spanish is actually our most common one we've got hundreds of videos already translated we have a whole team of translation volunteers you actually can be one of those if you'd like to help out we're actually going to convert the entire site into Spanish so not just the subtitles for all the videos but like all the wording on the site so it would be like a little flag you know you go to some websites and it's like you can choose your language um well it's going to be same thing nutrition facts outdoor where you can see in English when you see the entire site in Spanish um and then we're going to move to other languages to broaden the number of people that can have access to this life-changing life-saving information but right now you can access those Spanish subtitles by just doing a search on nutrition facts at work and then clicking the spanish-language buttons all right Laura asked coumadin I've been diagnosed ah with a thrombus a clot warfare every day to maintain a 9r they're vegetarians does guarantee bristled without anticoagulants absolutely not you need anti if you have excessively clotting blood for whatever reason or if you have a heart valve or any kind of internal hardware that could cause your blood to clot although there is there are there's basically what's called salicylic acid which is kind of the active ingredient in aspirin found in plant foods not just in willow bark or as originally harvested from UM and so people eating plant-based diets particularly the spicy plant-based that's just a lot of salicylates in spices like cumin ma you will have blood levels of aspirin on which rival that of people actually taking a baby aspirin a small dose aspirin pill every day even though you're not on aspirin you have the same aspirin doses of your body that may actually been be beneficial in terms of reducing not only heart disease risk a stroke risk certain types of stroke risk as well as cancer risk and I've got a bunch of videos coming up on aspirin and cancer but that's not your blood would not be thin enough to prevent clots if you have some excessive clotting disorder and so if your physician wants you on coumadin then you need to to remain on coumadin as long and just make sure that you they titrate the greens consumption you dark green leafy vegetable consumption the mountain community does basically cumin is a vitamin k poison and so on if you eat a lot of vitamin K you need up your dose to keep them in line alright okay Lance okay um Lance is just making some comments that's good okay I'm gonna keep going down um um I don't know how to pronounce a Jo a with a little thing on it Oh I'm sorry I said he has an exam with 289 people on grams per milliliter of b12 as at a healthy level ma you assuming those the units I'm familiar with um yes that would be fine but you still would want to take the question is should continue to take vitamin b12 of course you should a 2500 microns once a week of cyanic of elements probably all you or anyone should need I mean you say well wait a second more fine levels are fine well they won't be fine for long if you don't get a regular reliable source of vitamin b12 um Sarah read an article from a nutrigenomics company saying that your genes determine whether or not animal or plant base to make 3s are good for you all mega 3s are originally plant-based and are then created by animals such as yourselves when you eat them there may be polymorphisms but which means kind of gene variations in mod Delta 60 saturates enzymes the elongation enzymes but and so one may want to take a preformed long-chain omega-3 fatty acid supplement I've got a bunch of videos new videos about that so check it out a vitamin Lindsay says what do I think about intermittent fasting I've got a bunch of videos on intermittent fasting coming up I keep saying that but I do and it's actually a really complex topic um and but I will be talking about all the variations of intermittent fast and water-only fasting the timing duration meals all sorts of good stuff it's all coming out um it's not that I'm trying to keep anything from you I just haven't read all the science yet there's tremendous load hundreds of new articles um and so I want to make sure I have a sense of where they're going just doing kind of a light reading but I wanted to a deep dive before I before I synthesize all the available science alright Michael good name s if you take a DHA EPA supplement how much ala should get every day as it's still important to keep in to make a six to make a three ratio 4 to 1 um so um if you're already getting prima so the reason one wants to keep their ratio relatively low makes 16 mega threes is to kind of facilitate your body's elongation stretching omega-3s found in flax seeds and walnuts not into the long-chain versions um but also G still need to do that if you're taking um you know and and you need to get a source of of of ala like flex seeds or walnuts or hemp nuts or chia seeds if you're already taking that and my answer is yes to both but not for the reason one might think so I mean what's the recommendation to about make six ratio it stay away from junky vegetables like Cornell safflower oil sunflower oil concealed oil so you'd still want to do that regardless for all sorts of reasons and why so do you not have to take flax seeds now if you're getting a preformed source of of DHA will make you three something only reason we eat a super healthy foods like black seeds and walnuts they have other health problem in compounds for example flax seeds have these anti-cancer lignin compounds which you know you would be missing out on so it's still stick with my daily doesn't recommend actually get a tablespoon of ground flax seeds every day for the other health benefits priscila talked about BPA at the beginning ah ma soeur know are there plant foods that reverse postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and small fiber neuropathy um I do not know of any um but if you do a PubMed search so if you go PubMed gov govt um that's the database National Library of Medicine or just medical library in the world and you type in whatever grow that you're interested in and the word diet or foods or such and Stace come up um I'd be have it look at them send them my way I will dig them up and if there's something interesting useful for others I will make a video about it and share with others alright Steve what foods would I recommend for a toddler to have on a daily basis Oh like a daily dozen toddler version that's a good idea I should come up with that um until I do though I would encourage you to check out wonderful sources like anything Brenda Davis is written or read mangles has written they both done wonderful books and chapters on feeding healthy diets to infants and small children um Cristina named assessing research on diet macular degeneration very certain there is I just haven't looked at it yet I haven't got to my latest I folder um studies I could actually look at it now but it would take some time but if there is I realize that's an issue that a lot of people deal with and we'll definitely do any videos on any new exciting developments in that area David asks what foods increased stamina and energy I need more than a caffeine jolt um well um the question is I mean you should

Should we be concerned that eating dried fruit may make us fat? Remember that fig study I covered, that added 14 figs to people’s daily diets? Surprisingly, that did not lead to significant weight gain. Wait a second. That’s 300 calories of figs a day. Over five weeks, that’s 10,000 calories. Did they disappear into thin air? No. Figs are so packed with fiber, and satiating, that even without trying, people just ended up eating less of other foods throughout the day. I get full just thinking about eating 14 figs a day. Was this just a fluke, though? Let’s look at those other new studies. What about adding three-quarters of a cup of dried apples to your diet, every day, for a year? 200 extra calories a day— but no significant change in weight. 200 extra calories of prunes a day, for a year? No significant change in weight. And, the same thing with a month of a daily 300-calorie load of dates. In general, the 5-10% of Americans that average a tablespoon or more of dried fruit a day tend to be less overweight, less obese, have a slimmer waist, and less abdominal obesity. They tended to eat more, but yet weighed less. Similar findings were found for those that eat nuts or nut butters— lower body mass index, and a slimmer waist. In past videos, I’ve explored the potential mechanisms, right? Nuts are filling, may boost metabolism, and may end up flushing some of their fat down the toilet. What if you put them both together? What would be the effect of adding daily fruit and nut bars on top of one’s regular diet, for two months? Took about a hundred folks who were overweight, randomized into two groups. Half ate their regular diet, and the other half ate their regular diet, plus two fruit and nut bars a day, totaling an extra 340 calories. But these weren’t candy calories; these were largely whole plant food calories— dried fruits and nuts. Two daily fruit and nut bars for two months did not cause weight gain. And, they had extra sugar in them. Maybe that’s why cholesterol didn’t get better, despite the nuts, which should have helped. “Recipes with…less sugar…might be expected to improve lipid profiles.” So, that’s brands, you know, like this.

What about the consumption of fruit and vegetables and risk of frailty in the elderly? Higher fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with lower frailty as well, in a dose-response manner, meaning more fruit less frailty, and more vegetables too, but these were all observational studies, which can’t alone prove cause-and-effect. What happens when you  put foods to the test? Well, no positive influence ingesting chia seed oil on human running performance, but there was an effect found for spinach supplementation on exercise-induced oxidation stress. And by spinach supplementation, they meant they just gave some guys some fresh raw spinach leaves, one gram per kilo, so like a quarter of a bunch a day for two weeks and then they had them  run a half marathon. And, they found that “chronic daily oral supplementation of spinach,” uh meaning like eating a salad, has alleviating effects on known markers of oxidative stress and muscle damage, Here’s what happens when you run a half marathon without spinach: a big spike in oxidative stress, blood malondealdehyde levels, that stay up hours or even days later. In the spinach group, the before and after 2 weeks of spinach doesn’t seem to make much of a difference, but put the body under pressure, and then you can really see the difference. Your body is better able to deal with the stress. And, if you look at the resulting muscle damage, as measured by creatine kinase  leakage from your muscles (that\'s an enzyme that should  be in your muscles, not leaking out into your blood), you start out at about 100 and go up to 200 after the half marathon, right after, 2 hours later. But it’s the next day where you really feel it, that delayed onset muscle soreness, with CK levels reaching 600 before coming back down. Okay, that’s without spinach, though. On spinach, you get a similar immediate post-race bump, but it’s that next day where spinach really shines. You don’t get that same next-day spike, and so, for a competitive athlete, that quicker recovery may get you back training harder sooner. They attribute this to the anti- inflammatory effects of spinach. Same with black currant juice. After some hardcore weight lifting, muscle damage indicators  go up and stay up, whereas the same lifting drinking berries, and it goes up, but  comes right back down. But these were just measures of a biomarker of muscle soreness. What about actual soreness? If you look at the effects of tart cherry juice on recovery following prolonged, intermittent sprints in soccer players, you see the same kind of reduction in biomarkers of inflammation, but more importantly, less resulting muscle soreness. Here’s the soreness reported in the days afterwards in the placebo group. Only about half in the cherry group. Then, they measured maximum voluntary isometric contractions of the leg muscles, which understandably took a hit in the days after the intense workout, but not in the cherry group. They conclude that participants supplemented with a tart cherry concentrate were able to maintain greater  functional performance. But, that was testing like how high can you vertically jump. They didn’t actually see if they played soccer any better. But, this study on purple grape juice actually showed an ergogenic effect in recreational runners by promoting increased time to exhaustion, where you ramp people up on a treadmill and see how long they  can go before collapsing. After a month of drinking a grape Kool-Aid type placebo control drink, no real change in performance, but a whopping 15% improvement in the real grape group– hung on for another 12 minutes. They used juice, so they could make a matched placebo control drink, but you can buy concord grapes fresh, or tart cherries fresh, frozen, or water-packed in a can.

Solis I didn't say that I only said if you have Crohn's disease and or hidradenitis suppurativa everybody else feel free to eat your nutrition yeast in fact it's a way to get your vitamin b12 if it's fortified with b12 oh speaking of b12 ApS is duckweed a safe plant source for b12 and the answer is not until it's proven to be right I mean that's critically important all right vitamin b12 so the company that makes it or that packaged it that sells it purports on to show active b12 that is improvement until people with b12 deficiency are a given duckweed is a sole source and their b12 level recovers right there home assistant comes down if they're fully replete or they're methylmalonic acid level drops it's the only way right um so there's a lot of tests for b12 that don't necessarily show active b12 there are b12 analogs cause your body can't use fools our body actually they're like connect as anti b12 so you just do not want to mess around you can end up paralyzed demented or dead from a b12 deficiency so until it's proven to be a reliable source where they actually do a clinical study you could it's easy to find vegans low in b12 right because so many vegans are too stupid to not to to not supplement they are stupid for not supplementing and um so you put pretend of them twenty of them and give them some duckweed and see what happens and until then it's not a reliable source of b12 until it's proven to be a reliable source of b12 because it's not something you want to mess around with all right critically important all right and look even if they claimed that there's a bacteria that kind of lives in the duckweed that produce would be 12 let's say they do the study and they show that a batch of duckweed improves their their veto status okay that's great so you can you say that that batch of duckweed improves to be 12 it doesn't mean all duckweed or all the duckweed they even sell has active b12 maybe it has different bacteria that aren't making b12 at the moment so unless they can show reliably that whatever species of duckweed they have just always makes b12 that's always usable by people if that's not the case then you need to stick with supplements a vitamin b12 or vitamin b12 fortified foods okay Emily Paige Peron or posh a Peron says hi what you take on gluten flour homemade note well no salt say 1000 obviously so not a whole food but it's a green yellow or green light food um so it's a yellow light food it's the process plant food so it's a platform from which something bad good has been taken away or something bad has been added and here's this case nothing bad has been added but there has been something good taken away right you you know how to make seitan you wash away the fiber wash away some nutrition but but in terms of meat substitutes certainly better then you know everything else in the market right which has added sodium often added saturated fat of course what would be even better meets us to real whole food like legumes whole grains mushrooms these kind of things okay anyway tattooed woman asked please talk about nano volley pig in assists and how hard it is for the Oh for the body it turned carbohydrate into fat so tattooed women did not mean men denovo leap in Genesis she meant that de novo epigenesis so your body so it's true that if you over feed people calories it's easier to make people gain weight giving people fat calories in carbohydrate calories in fact you can make 100,000 College disappear by effective feeding people trying to over feed people carbohydrates opposed to fat I talked about this study but in long Vermont prisoners where they tried this experimental weight gain say they tried to get people to gain weight took one hundred thousand more calories on a mixed diet then then all fat died but but the problem it so but if you like you drink all ones if you drink a couple liters of soda a day even though you won't make a lot of fat you know where that fat is made that fat is made in your liver increases liver fat which is can dull the sensitivity to insulin in your liver and set you up for all sorts of badness so so yeah do not overeat my added sugars so yeah okay so even if it doesn't you're like oh it just puts a few grams of fat on your body huh yeah because where it is liver fat that's a bad thing increase your risk of fat liver disease again bad thing okay the chosen comment asks someone working in hospitals working for on for office it possible is it difficult to it is difficult to intermittent task I'm not eating the middle of night any recommendations I don't eat the middle of the night I mean that's there's not much you can do I mean there's all sorts of clonal biological badness that comes along with night shifts I'm like the light in the middle of the night that's not good but you can't do much about that but you can do something about eating so you don't eat it you still don't either die on you eat before you go to before you go to bed and in the morning or before you go to - - to work and in terms of well I'm gonna get so hungry going on that without food well you need to you know eat your thylakoids you know appetite suppressing foods cumin you know time by five coins you mean dark green leafy vegetables like have couple greens on groats intact""), Document(metadata={'description': 'Randomized

They’re just talking about associations, meaning berry eaters and nut eaters tend to have better brain function as they age after trying to control for a bunch of other lifestyle factors, but you don’t know if it’s cause and effect... until you put it to the test. Thankfully, we now have a growing number of interventional studies that have done just that. Randomized controlled trials where people eat berries or nuts and you can prove it— actually show improvements in cognitive performance, raising the berry nutty idea that we may be able to forestall or reverse the effects of neurodegeneration in aging with food. For example, this study on the effects of walnut consumption on cognitive performance. College students split up into groups doing two months of walnuts followed by two months of placebo or vice versa and then they switch. How do you make a placebo nut? They baked it in. They gave people banana bread with or without nuts; same ingredients, just one with walnuts, and those on the nuts showed a significant improvement in “inference capacity,” the ability to accurately draw conclusions from a set of facts, in other words, critical thinking. And so, on a practical level, maybe students or young professionals in fields that involve a great deal of critical thinking or decision-making could possibly benefit and gain a slight advantage through regular consumption of walnuts. Or this berry study, where they randomized folks to some crazy berry smoothie with blueberries, black currants, elderberries, lingonberries, strawberries, and…  a tomato. And not only did their bad cholesterol drop about 10 points, they performed better on short-term memory tests; so, good for the heart, good for the brain. And not just better on like pencil-and-paper tests, but real-world applications. Give people concord grape juice versus some fake grape Kool-Aid-type placebo, and you get improved performance on everyday tasks—like quicker response times in driving tests. Why not just give people concord grapes instead of juice? Well, then, it’s harder to create a placebo and, of course, the study was paid for by Welch’s. OK, fruit and nuts, what about vegetables? Consumers of cruciferous vegetables, like cabbage, cauliflower, kale, collards, broccoli and Brussels sprouts, have been found to perform better in several cognitive tests than non-users. In terms of cognitive decline with aging, women consuming the most green leafies did better, effectively slowing brain aging a year or two, and not just cruciferous, but other dark green leafies like spinach; so, maybe it’s the nitrates. As we age, our cerebral blood flow drops, the amount of blood flowing through our brain, which may be due to an age-related decrease in the production of nitric oxide, the open sesame molecule that dilates our blood vessels and is boosted by the consumption of nitrate-rich vegetables. This reduction in blood flow to the brain may be a major risk factor for the impairment of cognitive function and development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia. We know nitrate-rich vegetables like leafy greens and beets can improve physiological performance, like beet juice does for athletes, but what about cognitive performance? We’ll find out…next.')]","To help Kazuki avoid energy dips during the day, he can consider incorporating snacks that are rich in nutrients, provide sustained energy, and are convenient to consume. Based on Dr. Michael Greger's recommendations from NutritionFacts.org, here are some suitable snack options:

1. **Nuts**: Nuts are a healthy snack option that provide a good mix of protein, healthy fats, and fiber. They can help maintain energy levels throughout the day. Almonds, walnuts, and pistachios are some great choices. Dr. Greger highlights that nuts not only offer nutritional benefits but also have been shown to support cognitive health and weight management.

2. **Dried Fruits**: Snacking on dried fruits like raisins, dates, or prunes can be beneficial. Raisins, for instance, have been compared favorably to commercial sports gels and jelly beans for sustaining energy in athletes. They are a natural source of concentrated carbohydrates and are also palatable and nutritious.

3. **Fresh Fruits and Vegetables**: Fresh fruits like apples, bananas, or berries, and vegetables like carrot sticks or cherry tomatoes, provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which are essential for sustained energy. They are also hydrating which can help maintain energy levels.

4. **Whole Grain Snacks**: Whole grain crackers or a small portion of whole grain pasta can provide complex carbohydrates that are important for prolonged energy release. Pairing these with a hummus dip or a nut butter can add protein and healthy fats to balance the snack.

5. **Smoothies**: A smoothie made with a mix of fruits, vegetables, and perhaps a spoonful of nut butter or seeds can be a refreshing and energizing snack option. For example, blending spinach, berries, and banana with a bit of almond milk can create a nutritious smoothie that provides both immediate and sustained energy.

6. **Trail Mix**: Creating a trail mix with a combination of nuts, seeds, and dried fruits can offer a portable, energy-dense snack that is easy to consume on the go.

By choosing snacks that are rich in nutrients and have a balance of carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats, Kazuki can help prevent energy dips throughout the day and maintain steady energy levels.","To help Kazuki avoid energy dips during the day, he can consider incorporating snacks that are rich in nutrients, provide sustained energy, and are convenient to consume.

We have the juice study— what about whole fruits and vegetables? Using the largest twin registry in the world, researchers concluded last year that “greater fruit and vegetable consumption may lower the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.” The reason it’s so useful to study twins is that if one gets Alzheimer’s and the other doesn’t, it can give us special insight into environmental and dietary influences, since genetically, twins are so similar. “These findings emphasize the importance of including a greater proportion of fruits and vegetables in the diet for cognitive health.” But which ones are the best? In 2005, the Harvard Nurses Study reported that high consumption of particularly cruciferous and green leafy vegetables were related to less cognitive decline. But it took until 2010 before dozens of plant foods were tested— all the way down to rutabagas. Now, this was done in Norway. They don’t eat a lot of plant foods in Norway. For example, the average daily bean consumption: 1.3 grams a day. That’s like one bean; maybe half a kidney bean. They found nearly all plant foods associated with better cognitive performance, including white potatoes, which was a pleasant surprise, and mushrooms. “The only negative cognitive association was [with increased intake] of white bread.” If you look at the data, they actually found negative results with another group of plant foods; not just white bread, but also cakes, pies, and cookies. Just because we’re eating a plant-based diet doesn’t mean it’s a healthy plant-based diet. Whole fruits appeared to beat out fruit juice; there was a nice dose response with fruits and veggies. The more you eat, the better, especially that first pound every day; apparently, a nice steep rise in benefit before it plateaus out a bit. And perhaps the most interesting finding: different foods seemed to boost different areas of the brain. For example, total vegetable consumption had the strongest positive associations with executive function, perceptual speed, global cognition, and semantic, or fact-based memory, whereas total fruit intake was more consistently associated with visuospatial skills and autobiographical memory. So, yes, while carrots and cruciferous cabbage-family vegetables seemed to win out above the rest, we have to eat a variety of whole healthy plant foods, because they each tend to shore up different cognitive domains.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Cocoa and nitrite-rich vegetables, such as green leafies and beets, are put to the test for cognitive function.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

However, little evidence on its role in human brain function existed... until it was put to the test. Feed people lots of green leafy vegetables with some beet juice to boot, and then measure cerebral blood flow. See that spot there with improved flow? That’s a critical brain area known to be involved in executive functioning. OK, but improved blood flow doesn’t necessarily translate into improved cognitive function. For example, feed people tart cherries, and despite some indication of improved blood flow, this didn’t appear to manifest as improved cognitive performance. And indeed, some of the initial studies were disappointing. Give people over a cup of cooked spinach and no immediate boost in the ability to carry out simple tasks, but that may be because the tests weren’t hard enough. Give people a similar battery of simple tasks after consuming cocoa and no significant effect. But put people through a more demanding set of tasks, and you can see acute improvements in cognitive performance after cocoa consumption. The tasks they’re talking about is like counting backwards in 3’s for minutes at a time. What if you tried doing that same thing after drinking two cups of organic beet juice, which has about the same amount of nitrate as two cups of cooked arugula? Significantly improved performance, in terms of more correct answers on the sustained subtraction task. These results suggest that a single dose of nitrate-rich vegetables can modify brain function, and that this is likely to be as a result of increased nitric oxide synthesis. OK,  but how do we know it’s the nitrate? Beets are packed with all sorts of phytonutrients like the betalain red pigment. One way to tease it out would be to come up with some kind of nitrate- depleted beet juice— has all the other stuff in beets, but just missing the nitrate— to see if that works just as well, and that’s exactly what researchers did. They developed a nitrate- depleted beetroot juice placebo. And compared to that, within two weeks of supplementation with the real stuff this group of diabetics got a significant improvement in reaction time. Now we’re just talking 13 milliseconds here, but other interventions like balance training that only increased reaction time like 7 milliseconds were associated with significantly lower fall risk. And of course, in athletes, those fractions of a second can sometimes make a difference. At very high exercise intensities, cognitive task performance deteriorates, with a pronounced detrimental effect on reaction time, and that may be just when you need it the most. Like you\'re playing football or something and need to make rapid appropriate decisions while simultaneously going all out. And once again, beets to the rescue, significantly reducing reaction time; so, not only improving physical performance but mental performance as well. Yeah, but can it improve the structure of your brain? Things like cognitive training and aerobic exercise can actually affect the structure of the human brain. There’s something called neuroplasticity, where your brain can adapt, changing its configuration as you like learn to play piano or something. We used to think only younger brains could do this, but now we know it can occur in the aging brain as well. Can’t “beet” that—or can you? We didn\'t know… until now. Here’s your brain before and after a six-week exercise program, measuring connectivity between various parts of your brain that control movement. No big change. But, what about the same amount of exercise before… and after drinking some beet juice too? Big difference. The exercise plus beetroot juice group developed brain networks that more closely resembled those of younger adults, showing the potential enhanced neuroplasticity conferred by combining exercise and nitrate-rich vegetables.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Fasting and exercise can raise BDNF levels in our brain (which plays a critical role in depression treatment), but this can also be achieved by eating and avoiding certain foods.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

BDNF controls the growth of new nerve cells, and “so, low levels [may explain the] atrophy of specific brain areas… [you see] among depressed patients.” That may be one of the reasons exercise is so good for our brains. Start an hour-a-day exercise regimen, and within three months you can get a quadrupling of BDNF release from your brain. This makes sense. Any time we were desperate to catch prey or desperate not to become prey ourselves, we needed to be cognitively sharp. And so, when we’re fasting or exercising and in a negative calorie balance, our brain starts churning out BDNF to make sure we’re firing on all cylinders. So, of course Big Pharma is eager to create drugs to mimic this effect, but is there any way to boost BDNF naturally? Yes, I just said it— fasting and exercise! Okay, okay, but is there anything we can add to our diet to boost BDNF? Well, higher intakes of dietary flavonoids appear to be protectively associated with symptoms of depression. The Harvard Nurse’s Study followed tens of thousands of women for years and found that those who were eating the most appeared to reduce their risk of coming down with depression. Flavonoids occur naturally in plants, and so there’s a substantial amount in a variety of healthy foods. But wait…how do we know the benefits are from the flavonoids and not just from eating healthier in general? You don’t know until you ... put it to the test. See, some fruits and vegetables have more than others. Apples have more than apricots, plums more than peaches, red cabbage more than white, kale more than cucumbers. So, if you randomize people into one of three groups: more high-flavonoid fruits and vegetables, more low-flavonoid fruits and vegetables, or no extra fruits and vegetables at all, after 18 weeks, only the high-flavonoid group got a significant boost in BDNF levels, which corresponded to an improvement in cognitive performance. The BDNF boost may help explain why each additional daily serving of fruits and  vegetables is associated with a three percent decrease in the risk of depression. A teaspoon a day of the spice turmeric may boost BDNF levels more than 50 percent within a month, consistent with the other randomized controlled trials that have so far been done. Nuts may help too. In the PREDIMED study where people were randomized to be sent weekly batches of nuts or extra virgin olive oil, the nut group lowered their risk of having low BDNF levels by 78 percent. And brain-derived neurotrophic factor is not just implicated in depression but schizophrenia as well. Have those with schizophrenia undergo a 12-week exercise program and they get a significant boost in BDNF levels, leading the researchers to suggest “that exercise induced modulation of BDNF may play an important role in developing non-pharmacological treatment for chronic schizophreni[a] patients.” Okay, but what actually happened to their schizophrenia symptoms? Let’s find out. Thirty individuals with schizophrenia randomized to ramp up to 40 minutes of aerobic exercise three times a week or not. And there did appear to be an improvement in psychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations, as well as increasing their quality of life. In fact, you can actually visualize what happened in their brains. Loss of brain volume in a certain region appears to be a feature of schizophrenia, but 30 minutes of exercise three times a week and you can get up to a 20 percent increase in size of that region within three months. Calorie restriction may also increase BDNF levels in schizophrenics, but they didn’t just have them eat less, but eat healthier— less saturated fat and sugar, and more fruits and veggies. It’s like the Soviet fasting trials for schizophrenia. They reported these truly unbelievable results, supposedly restoring people to function, fasting described as an “unparalleled achievement in the treatment of schizophrenia”. Okay, but part of the problem is that the diagnostic system the Soviets used is completely different, making any results hard to interpret. But they do have a subgroup that does seem to correspond to the Western definition, and they still report between 40 and 60 percent improvement rates from fasting. But that\'s not all they did. After being fasted for up to a month, they were put on a meat and egg-free diet, so when they report these remarkable effects even years later, that’s for those who stuck with the diet. Those who broke the diet evidently relapsed, and the closer the diet was followed the better the effect. They note that “not all patients [were able to] remain vegetarian,” but they tried to keep meat to a minimum. And look, we know from randomized controlled trials that just removing meat and eggs can improve mental states within even just two weeks, and so it’s hard to know what role the fasting itself played in the reported improvements. A single high-fat meal can drop BDNF levels within hours. And you can prove it’s the fat itself by seeing the same thing injecting fat straight into their veins. Perhaps that helps explain why increased consumption of saturated fats in a high-fat diet may contribute to brain dysfunction— neurodegenerative diseases, long-term memory loss, cognitive impairment. Maybe that helps explain why the standard American diet has been linked to a higher risk of depression, dietary factors modulating the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

We have supercomputers in our heads, and they drain a lot of power. That’s where this molecule comes in: creatine. It acts as a quick reserve energy boost when your fuel supply— oxygen and blood sugar— is running low. Creatine is naturally produced in our liver, kidneys, and pancreas, and transported to the brain and our muscles— the two places we need the most rapid energy deployment. Now if you were to take a Hannibal Lecter bite out of someone, would that extra creatine you eat, on top of what you’re already making, give your brain a boost? That study might not get past the ethics board, but this one did: “The influence of creatine supplementation on the cognitive functioning of vegetarians and omnivores.” In this simplified, normalized version of the data, before the creatine supplement was consumed, the memory capacity of the vegetarians and meat-eaters was similar (vegetarians in white; meat-eaters in black). So, they started out about the same place. However, after four days of consuming a creatine supplement, memory was better in vegetarians, compared to those who consumed meat, whereas in those who were meat-eaters, the consumption of the creatine supplement was associated with poorer memory, compared to baseline. So, the vegetarians got a brain boost, but the meat-eaters didn’t. This may be because meat-eaters have downregulated creatine synthesis. Their body doesn’t make a whole lot, because they get it in their diet by eating muscles. Maybe not this kind of calf, but at least maybe this one. So, their body is like, “Why bother,” whereas the vegetarians are cranking the stuff out all the time. So when they take a creatine supplement, it may be like they’re getting a double dose. They’re getting what they take, in addition to what they already make. Still too early to tell what’s really going on, but in the meanwhile, if you eat vegetarian, should you consider taking creatine supplements? “Creatine: are the benefits worth the risk?” This is in the context of sports supplementation. That was actually asked more generally of the editor-in-chief of the Harvard Health Letter recently, to which he replied, “For now, to be on the safe side, I’d advise against taking creatine, concerned that creatine supplements might contain toxic impurities.” Was he just being paranoid? Nope. “Levels of…organic contaminants and heavy metals in creatine…supplements.” They tested 33 different brands on the market, and found a whopping 50% of them exceeded the maximum level recommended by the European Food Safety Authority for at least one contaminant.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'What is the best source of lutein, the primary carotenoid antioxidant in the brain?\n\nSubscribe to Dr. Greger’s free nutrition newsletter at https://www.nutritionfacts.org/subscribe and get a free recipe from his new HOW NOT TO DIE COOKBOOK.

However, it\'s only now becoming clear that the consumption of diets rich in plant foods can influence neuro- inflammation, brain inflammation, leading to the expression of cytoprotective, cell protective, and restorative proteins. Just over the last decade, remarkable progress has been made to realize that oxidative stress and chronic, low-grade inflammation, are major risk factors underlying brain aging, so no wonder antioxidant and anti-inflammatory foods may help. The brain is especially vulnerable to free radical attack, oxidative stress, due to its high fat content and its cauldron of high metabolic activity. You don\'t want your brains to go rancid. So you\'d think one of the major fat-soluble dietary antioxidants like beta-carotene would step in, but the major carotenoid concentrated in the brain is actually lutein; the brain just preferentially sucks it up. For example, if you  look at the oldest old, like in the Georgia centenarian study, recognizing that oxidation is involved in age-related cognitive decline, they figured dietary antioxidants may play a role in its prevention or delay, so they looked at eight different ones, vitamin A, vitamin E, on down the list, and only lutein was significantly related to better cognition. Now in this study they looked at brain tissue on autopsy. By then it\'s a little too late. So how could you study the effects of diet on the brain while you\'re still alive? If only there was a way we could physically look into the living brain with  our own two eyes. There is! With our own two eyes. The retina, the back of our eyeball, is actually an extension of our central nervous system, an outpouching of the brain during development, and right in the middle there\'s a spot. This is what the doctor sees when they look into your eye with that bright light. That spot, called the macula, is our HD camera, where you get the highest resolution vision, and it\'s packed with lutein. And indeed, levels in the retina correspond to levels in the rest of your brain, so your eyes can be a window into your brain. So now we can finally do studies on live people to see if diet can affect lutein levels in the eyes, which reflects lutein levels in the brain, and see if that correlates with improvements in cognitive function. And indeed, significant correlations exist between the amount of macular pigment, these plant pigments like lutein in your eye, and cognitive test scores. You can demonstrate this on functional MRI scans, suggesting lutein and a related plant pigment called zeaxanthin promote cognitive functioning in old age by enhancing neural efficiency, the efficiency by which our nerves communicate. Like check out this cool study on white matter integrity using something called diffusion tensor imaging, which provides unique insights into brain network connectivity, allowing you to follow the nerve tracts throughout the brain. And researchers were able to show enhanced circuit integrity based on how much lutein and zeaxanthin they could see in people\'s eyes— further evidence of a meaningful relationship between diet and integrity of our brains, particularly in regions vulnerable to age-related decline. So do Alzheimer\'s patients have less of this macular pigment? Significantly less lutein in their eyes, significantly less lutein in their blood, and a higher occurrence of macular degeneration, where this pigment layer gets destroyed. The thickness of this plant pigment layer in your eyes can be measured and may be a potential marker for the beginnings of Alzheimer\'s. Let\'s not wait that long, though. We know macular pigment density is related to cognitive function in older people. What about during middle age? One apparent consequence of aging appears to be loss of some aspects of cognitive control, which starts out early, in mid-adulthood, but not in everybody, suggesting maybe something like diet could be driving some of the differences. Here\'s a measure of cognitive control, showing younger, on average, do better than older adults. But older adults who have high macular pigment, lots of lutein in the back of their eyes, do significantly better. These results suggest that the protective role of carotenoids like lutein within the brain may be evident during early and middle adulthood, decades prior to the onset of more apparent cognitive decline later in life. You can take 20-year-olds and show superior auditory function in those with more macular pigment in their eyes. Look, the auditory system, our hearing, like the rest of the central nervous system, is ultimately constructed and maintained by diet, and it is therefore, not surprisingly, sensitive to dietary intake throughout life, all the way back to childhood. Higher macular pigment is associated with higher academic achievement among school children. You can look into a kid\'s eyes and get some sense of how well they may do in subjects like math and writing. This finding is important because macular lutein is modifiable and can be manipulated by dietary intake. OK, OK, so where is lutein found? The avocado and egg industries like to boast about how much of these macular pigments they have in their products, but the real superstars are dark green leafy vegetables. A half cup of kale has 50 times more than an egg, a spinach salad, or a 50-egg omelet? And the earlier the better. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should definitely be checking off my Daily Dozen greens servings. But it\'s also apparently never too late. While some age-related cognitive decline is to be expected, these effects may be less pronounced among those eating more green and leafy, but you don\'t know for sure until you put it to the test, which we\'ll explore next.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'What is the best source of lutein, the primary carotenoid antioxidant in the brain?\n\nWhat about just taking lutein supplements?

However, it\'s only now becoming clear that the consumption of diets rich in plant foods can influence neuro- inflammation, brain inflammation, leading to the expression of cytoprotective, cell protective, and restorative proteins. Just over the last decade, remarkable progress has been made to realize that oxidative stress and chronic, low-grade inflammation, are major risk factors underlying brain aging, so no wonder antioxidant and anti-inflammatory foods may help. The brain is especially vulnerable to free radical attack, oxidative stress, due to its high fat content and its cauldron of high metabolic activity. You don\'t want your brains to go rancid. So you\'d think one of the major fat-soluble dietary antioxidants like beta-carotene would step in, but the major carotenoid concentrated in the brain is actually lutein; the brain just preferentially sucks it up. For example, if you  look at the oldest old, like in the Georgia centenarian study, recognizing that oxidation is involved in age-related cognitive decline, they figured dietary antioxidants may play a role in its prevention or delay, so they looked at eight different ones, vitamin A, vitamin E, on down the list, and only lutein was significantly related to better cognition. Now in this study they looked at brain tissue on autopsy. By then it\'s a little too late. So how could you study the effects of diet on the brain while you\'re still alive? If only there was a way we could physically look into the living brain with  our own two eyes. There is! With our own two eyes. The retina, the back of our eyeball, is actually an extension of our central nervous system, an outpouching of the brain during development, and right in the middle there\'s a spot. This is what the doctor sees when they look into your eye with that bright light. That spot, called the macula, is our HD camera, where you get the highest resolution vision, and it\'s packed with lutein. And indeed, levels in the retina correspond to levels in the rest of your brain, so your eyes can be a window into your brain. So now we can finally do studies on live people to see if diet can affect lutein levels in the eyes, which reflects lutein levels in the brain, and see if that correlates with improvements in cognitive function. And indeed, significant correlations exist between the amount of macular pigment, these plant pigments like lutein in your eye, and cognitive test scores. You can demonstrate this on functional MRI scans, suggesting lutein and a related plant pigment called zeaxanthin promote cognitive functioning in old age by enhancing neural efficiency, the efficiency by which our nerves communicate. Like check out this cool study on white matter integrity using something called diffusion tensor imaging, which provides unique insights into brain network connectivity, allowing you to follow the nerve tracts throughout the brain. And researchers were able to show enhanced circuit integrity based on how much lutein and zeaxanthin they could see in people\'s eyes— further evidence of a meaningful relationship between diet and integrity of our brains, particularly in regions vulnerable to age-related decline. So do Alzheimer\'s patients have less of this macular pigment? Significantly less lutein in their eyes, significantly less lutein in their blood, and a higher occurrence of macular degeneration, where this pigment layer gets destroyed. The thickness of this plant pigment layer in your eyes can be measured and may be a potential marker for the beginnings of Alzheimer\'s. Let\'s not wait that long, though. We know macular pigment density is related to cognitive function in older people. What about during middle age? One apparent consequence of aging appears to be loss of some aspects of cognitive control, which starts out early, in mid-adulthood, but not in everybody, suggesting maybe something like diet could be driving some of the differences. Here\'s a measure of cognitive control, showing younger, on average, do better than older adults. But older adults who have high macular pigment, lots of lutein in the back of their eyes, do significantly better. These results suggest that the protective role of carotenoids like lutein within the brain may be evident during early and middle adulthood, decades prior to the onset of more apparent cognitive decline later in life. You can take 20-year-olds and show superior auditory function in those with more macular pigment in their eyes. Look, the auditory system, our hearing, like the rest of the central nervous system, is ultimately constructed and maintained by diet, and it is therefore, not surprisingly, sensitive to dietary intake throughout life, all the way back to childhood. Higher macular pigment is associated with higher academic achievement among school children. You can look into a kid\'s eyes and get some sense of how well they may do in subjects like math and writing. This finding is important because macular lutein is modifiable and can be manipulated by dietary intake. OK, OK, so where is lutein found? The avocado and egg industries like to boast about how much of these macular pigments they have in their products, but the real superstars are dark green leafy vegetables. A half cup of kale has 50 times more than an egg, a spinach salad, or a 50-egg omelet? And the earlier the better. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should definitely be checking off my Daily Dozen greens servings. But it\'s also apparently never too late. While some age-related cognitive decline is to be expected, these effects may be less pronounced among those eating more green and leafy, but you don\'t know for sure until you put it to the test, which we\'ll explore next.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Avocados, greens, and lutein and zeaxanthin supplements are put to the test for improving cognitive function.\n\nWhat is this lutein stuff?

Dark green leafy vegetables are packed with a brain antioxidant called lutein. And so increasing our greens intake could be an important public health strategy for reducing the risk of visual or cognitive impairment. Lutein is the dominant dietary pigment in the retina of the eye as well as the brain. And so not surprising that macular pigment— the concentration of lutein in the center of your eye called the macula— was found to be significantly correlated with levels in the brain, which may explain the link between how much of these greens nutrients you can see in the back of the eye and cognitive function. The neuroprotection is assumed to be because lutein is such a powerful antioxidant, but it also has anti-inflammatory properties. This relationship between lutein, and another greens nutrient called zeaxanthin, and visual and cognitive health throughout the lifespan is compelling. But that was based on observational studies, where you observe that higher lutein levels and brain function seem to go together, but you don\'t know if it\'s cause and effect until you put it to the test. Could lutein and zeaxanthin be supplemented as part of a lifestyle intervention to both improve brain function and reduce the probability of slipping into dementia? The reason everyone is so excited about the possibility is because of the hopeful data from eye health studies that have convinced many ophthalmologists to start recommending people start increasing their lutein and zeaxanthin intake to prevent and treat macular degeneration, a leading cause of age-related vision loss. You don\'t have to take pills, though. Adding as little as 60 grams of spinach a day for a month— that\'s like one-fifth of a 10-ounce package of frozen spinach— can significantly boost macular pigment in most people. And it not just good for treating diseased eyes. A randomized, placebo-controlled study found that these greens goodies can improve visual processing speed in young healthy people. That\'s like when you\'re trying to hit a fastball and your body has to start reacting before you even consciously register it— with real-world benefits outside the major leagues, improving, for example, visual driving performance. OK, but what about cognition? A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adults, average age 73, given the equivalent of about a half cup a day\'s worth of cooked kale, or a full cup of cooked spinach, and got significant improvements in cognitive function compared to those randomized to the placebo. It may even work in young adults too, average age 21. Daily supplementation with that same amount of lutein and zeaxanthin not only increased their macular pigment, but resulted in significant improvements in brain function—spatial memory, reasoning ability, and complex attention. Have they ever tried putting whole foods to the test? Hard to get Americans to eat greens every day, but not so hard to get them to eat guacamole. This study tested the effects of the intake of avocado on cognition, a six-month, randomized, controlled trial. What was the control? One avocado a day, or a potato or a cup of chickpeas, and those in the avocado group had a significant improvement in cognitive function. But to the Avocado Board\'s chagrin, so did the tater and chickpea group. That\'s the problem with having healthy placebos. Maybe they should have used iceberg lettuce or something. What about the impact on cognition of those who really need it, Alzheimer\'s disease patients? Their vision got better, that\'s good, but no significant changes in cognitive function. Now it\'s possible that eating whole foods, like dark green leafies, might have worked better than just the pigments in pill form. Yes, oxidation and inflammation appear to be key to both Alzheimer\'s and macular degeneration, but neither disease seems particularly amenable to late-stage treatments. That\'s why prevention is the key. Reducing oxidation and inflammation in the earliest stages may be our most promising approach.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Avocados, greens, and lutein and zeaxanthin supplements are put to the test for improving cognitive function.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Why does frequent  consumption of vegetables appear to cut ones odds of  depression by more than half? And by more frequent they  mean eating vegetables not 3 or more times a day, but just 3 or more times a week. But even that seemed to cut  the odds of developing depression by 60% after controlling for  a long list of variables. In the 2012 study that found that eliminating animal products improved mood within 2 weeks, the researchers blamed  arachidonic acid, primarily in chicken and eggs, which may adversely  impact mental health via a cascade of  brain inflammation. But better moods on  plant-based diets could also be from  the good stuff in plants, a class of phytonutrients that crosses the blood  brain barrier into our heads. This recent review in the  journal Nutritional Neuroscience, suggests that eating lots  of fruits and vegetables ""may present a noninvasive  natural and inexpensive"" ""therapeutic means to  support a healthy brain."" Yeah, but how? Well, to understand the latest, we need to understand  the underlying biology, the so-called monoamine  theory of depression - the thought that  depression may arise out of a chemical  imbalance in the brain. Here\'s the oversimplified version: One of the ways that billions  of nerves in our brain communicate with one another  is through chemical signals called neurotransmitters. Here\'s the end of one nerve  and the beginning of another. This is what it actually  looks like under a microscope. Note the two nerve cells  don\'t actually touch— there\'s a physical  gap between them. To bridge that gap,  when one nerve wants to tap the other  on the shoulder it releases chemicals  into that gap, including three monoamines: serotonin, dopamine,  and norepinephrine. These neurotransmitters  then float over to the other nerve  to get its attention. The first nerve then  sucks them back up to be reused the next  time it wants to talk, but it\'s also constantly  manufacturing more, and an enzyme, monoamine oxidase, is constantly chewing them up to maintain just the right amount. The way cocaine appears to work is by acting as a monoamine  re-uptake inhibitor. It blocks the first nerve  from sucking back up those three chemicals and so there\'s this constant  tapping on the shoulder, this constant signaling  to the next nerve. Amphetamines work  in the same way, but also increase  monoamine release. Ecstacy works like speed, but just causes comparatively  more serotonin release. After awhile, the next nerve may be like ""enough already!"" and down-regulate its receptors to turn down the volume. It puts in ear plugs.  So you need more and more of the drug to get  the same effect. Then when you are  not on the drug you may feel crappy because  normal volume transmission just isn\'t getting  through as much. Antidepressants are thought  to work along similar mechanisms. People who are depressed  appear to have elevated levels of monoamine  oxidase in their brain. That\'s the enzyme that breaks  down those neurotransmitters, and so if you have too much of that enzyme in critical parts of your brain (the black circles are the levels  in the brains of depressed individuals, and white circles are that  of the healthy individuals), if the levels of your neurotransmitter- eating enzyme is elevated, then your levels of  neurotransmitters drops, and you become depressed,  or so the theory goes. So a number of different classes  of drugs have been developed. The tricyclic antidepressants, named because they have  three rings like a tricycle, appear to block norepinephrine  and dopamine re-uptake, and so even though your enzymes may be eating these up  at an accelerated rate, what gets released  sticks around longer. Then there came the  SSRIs like Prozac, the selective serotonin  re-uptake inhibitors. Now you can know  what that means— they just blocks the  re-uptake of serotonin. Then there are drugs  that just block the re-uptake of  norepinephrine, or more dopamine  or the opposite. But if the problem is too much  high levels of monoamine oxidase, why not just  block the enzyme? Make a monoamine oxidase inhibitor— and of course they did, but they\'re considered  drugs of last resort because of serious side effects, not the least of which is  the dreaded ""cheese effect,"" where eating certain  foods like certain cheeses while on the drug can have  potentially fatal consequences. If only there was a way  to tamp down the activity of this enzyme without the whole bleed-into-your-brain-thing  and die-thing. Now we can finally talk  about the latest theory as to why fruits and vegetables  may improve our mood. There are inhibitors of that depression- associated enzyme in various plants. There are phytonutrients in spices, such as cloves, oregano,  cinnamon, nutmeg, but people don\'t eat enough spices to get enough into the brain. This dark green leafy has a lot, but its name is tobacco, which may actually  be one of the reasons cigarettes make smokers  feel so good. OK, but what if you don\'t want  brain bleeds or lung cancer? Well, there is a phytonutrient found  in apples, berries, and grapes, and kale, onions, and green tea that may indeed affect our brain  biology enough to improve our mood.')]","For someone working in a creative field looking to improve mental clarity and boost creativity, incorporating a variety of plant-based foods rich in nutrients that support brain health can be beneficial. Based on Dr. Michael Greger's insights, the following foods are particularly noteworthy:

1. **Berries**: Berries like blueberries, strawberries, and black currants have been shown to improve short-term memory and cognitive performance. They are high in antioxidants and can support overall brain health.

2. **Nuts**: Walnuts, in particular, are highlighted for their ability to enhance inferential reasoning, which is the ability to draw conclusions from facts. This could be beneficial for creative problem-solving and decision-making.

3. **Leafy Greens and Beets**: Foods rich in nitrates, such as spinach, kale, and beets, can enhance cognitive performance by boosting blood flow to the brain. This increased circulation helps to support brain function and may aid in maintaining mental clarity.

4. **Flavonoid-rich foods**: Apples, plums, red cabbage, and kale are high in flavonoids, which have been linked to improvements in cognitive performance and a decrease in the risk of depression.

5. **Foods rich in lutein**: Dark green leafy vegetables like kale and spinach are excellent sources of lutein, a carotenoid that is concentrated in the brain and supports neural efficiency. This can be beneficial for cognitive functions crucial in creative fields.

6. **Whole grains and complex carbohydrates**: These provide a steady source of energy to the brain, helping to maintain focus and clarity over longer periods.

Incorporating these foods into your diet can help enhance mental clarity and support creativity.

They’re just talking about associations, meaning berry eaters and nut eaters tend to have better brain function as they age after trying to control for a bunch of other lifestyle factors, but you don’t know if it’s cause and effect... until you put it to the test. Thankfully, we now have a growing number of interventional studies that have done just that. Randomized controlled trials where people eat berries or nuts and you can prove it— actually show improvements in cognitive performance, raising the berry nutty idea that we may be able to forestall or reverse the effects of neurodegeneration in aging with food. For example, this study on the effects of walnut consumption on cognitive performance. College students split up into groups doing two months of walnuts followed by two months of placebo or vice versa and then they switch. How do you make a placebo nut? They baked it in. They gave people banana bread with or without nuts; same ingredients, just one with walnuts, and those on the nuts showed a significant improvement in “inference capacity,” the ability to accurately draw conclusions from a set of facts, in other words, critical thinking. And so, on a practical level, maybe students or young professionals in fields that involve a great deal of critical thinking or decision-making could possibly benefit and gain a slight advantage through regular consumption of walnuts. Or this berry study, where they randomized folks to some crazy berry smoothie with blueberries, black currants, elderberries, lingonberries, strawberries, and…  a tomato. And not only did their bad cholesterol drop about 10 points, they performed better on short-term memory tests; so, good for the heart, good for the brain. And not just better on like pencil-and-paper tests, but real-world applications. Give people concord grape juice versus some fake grape Kool-Aid-type placebo, and you get improved performance on everyday tasks—like quicker response times in driving tests. Why not just give people concord grapes instead of juice? Well, then, it’s harder to create a placebo and, of course, the study was paid for by Welch’s. OK, fruit and nuts, what about vegetables? Consumers of cruciferous vegetables, like cabbage, cauliflower, kale, collards, broccoli and Brussels sprouts, have been found to perform better in several cognitive tests than non-users. In terms of cognitive decline with aging, women consuming the most green leafies did better, effectively slowing brain aging a year or two, and not just cruciferous, but other dark green leafies like spinach; so, maybe it’s the nitrates. As we age, our cerebral blood flow drops, the amount of blood flowing through our brain, which may be due to an age-related decrease in the production of nitric oxide, the open sesame molecule that dilates our blood vessels and is boosted by the consumption of nitrate-rich vegetables. This reduction in blood flow to the brain may be a major risk factor for the impairment of cognitive function and development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia. We know nitrate-rich vegetables like leafy greens and beets can improve physiological performance, like beet juice does for athletes, but what about cognitive performance?

We have the juice study— what about whole fruits and vegetables? Using the largest twin registry in the world, researchers concluded last year that “greater fruit and vegetable consumption may lower the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s disease.” The reason it’s so useful to study twins is that if one gets Alzheimer’s and the other doesn’t, it can give us special insight into environmental and dietary influences, since genetically, twins are so similar. “These findings emphasize the importance of including a greater proportion of fruits and vegetables in the diet for cognitive health.” But which ones are the best? In 2005, the Harvard Nurses Study reported that high consumption of particularly cruciferous and green leafy vegetables were related to less cognitive decline. But it took until 2010 before dozens of plant foods were tested— all the way down to rutabagas. Now, this was done in Norway. They don’t eat a lot of plant foods in Norway. For example, the average daily bean consumption: 1.3 grams a day. That’s like one bean; maybe half a kidney bean. They found nearly all plant foods associated with better cognitive performance, including white potatoes, which was a pleasant surprise, and mushrooms. “The only negative cognitive association was [with increased intake] of white bread.” If you look at the data, they actually found negative results with another group of plant foods; not just white bread, but also cakes, pies, and cookies. Just because we’re eating a plant-based diet doesn’t mean it’s a healthy plant-based diet. Whole fruits appeared to beat out fruit juice; there was a nice dose response with fruits and veggies. The more you eat, the better, especially that first pound every day; apparently, a nice steep rise in benefit before it plateaus out a bit. And perhaps the most interesting finding: different foods seemed to boost different areas of the brain. For example, total vegetable consumption had the strongest positive associations with executive function, perceptual speed, global cognition, and semantic, or fact-based memory, whereas total fruit intake was more consistently associated with visuospatial skills and autobiographical memory. So, yes, while carrots and cruciferous cabbage-family vegetables seemed to win out above the rest, we have to eat a variety of whole healthy plant foods, because they each tend to shore up different cognitive domains.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'What is the best source of lutein, the primary carotenoid antioxidant in the brain?\n\nSubscribe to Dr. Greger’s free nutrition newsletter at https://www.nutritionfacts.org/subscribe and get a free recipe from his new HOW NOT TO DIE COOKBOOK.

However, it\'s only now becoming clear that the consumption of diets rich in plant foods can influence neuro- inflammation, brain inflammation, leading to the expression of cytoprotective, cell protective, and restorative proteins. Just over the last decade, remarkable progress has been made to realize that oxidative stress and chronic, low-grade inflammation, are major risk factors underlying brain aging, so no wonder antioxidant and anti-inflammatory foods may help. The brain is especially vulnerable to free radical attack, oxidative stress, due to its high fat content and its cauldron of high metabolic activity. You don\'t want your brains to go rancid. So you\'d think one of the major fat-soluble dietary antioxidants like beta-carotene would step in, but the major carotenoid concentrated in the brain is actually lutein; the brain just preferentially sucks it up. For example, if you  look at the oldest old, like in the Georgia centenarian study, recognizing that oxidation is involved in age-related cognitive decline, they figured dietary antioxidants may play a role in its prevention or delay, so they looked at eight different ones, vitamin A, vitamin E, on down the list, and only lutein was significantly related to better cognition. Now in this study they looked at brain tissue on autopsy. By then it\'s a little too late. So how could you study the effects of diet on the brain while you\'re still alive? If only there was a way we could physically look into the living brain with  our own two eyes. There is! With our own two eyes. The retina, the back of our eyeball, is actually an extension of our central nervous system, an outpouching of the brain during development, and right in the middle there\'s a spot. This is what the doctor sees when they look into your eye with that bright light. That spot, called the macula, is our HD camera, where you get the highest resolution vision, and it\'s packed with lutein. And indeed, levels in the retina correspond to levels in the rest of your brain, so your eyes can be a window into your brain. So now we can finally do studies on live people to see if diet can affect lutein levels in the eyes, which reflects lutein levels in the brain, and see if that correlates with improvements in cognitive function. And indeed, significant correlations exist between the amount of macular pigment, these plant pigments like lutein in your eye, and cognitive test scores. You can demonstrate this on functional MRI scans, suggesting lutein and a related plant pigment called zeaxanthin promote cognitive functioning in old age by enhancing neural efficiency, the efficiency by which our nerves communicate. Like check out this cool study on white matter integrity using something called diffusion tensor imaging, which provides unique insights into brain network connectivity, allowing you to follow the nerve tracts throughout the brain. And researchers were able to show enhanced circuit integrity based on how much lutein and zeaxanthin they could see in people\'s eyes— further evidence of a meaningful relationship between diet and integrity of our brains, particularly in regions vulnerable to age-related decline. So do Alzheimer\'s patients have less of this macular pigment? Significantly less lutein in their eyes, significantly less lutein in their blood, and a higher occurrence of macular degeneration, where this pigment layer gets destroyed. The thickness of this plant pigment layer in your eyes can be measured and may be a potential marker for the beginnings of Alzheimer\'s. Let\'s not wait that long, though. We know macular pigment density is related to cognitive function in older people. What about during middle age? One apparent consequence of aging appears to be loss of some aspects of cognitive control, which starts out early, in mid-adulthood, but not in everybody, suggesting maybe something like diet could be driving some of the differences. Here\'s a measure of cognitive control, showing younger, on average, do better than older adults. But older adults who have high macular pigment, lots of lutein in the back of their eyes, do significantly better. These results suggest that the protective role of carotenoids like lutein within the brain may be evident during early and middle adulthood, decades prior to the onset of more apparent cognitive decline later in life. You can take 20-year-olds and show superior auditory function in those with more macular pigment in their eyes. Look, the auditory system, our hearing, like the rest of the central nervous system, is ultimately constructed and maintained by diet, and it is therefore, not surprisingly, sensitive to dietary intake throughout life, all the way back to childhood. Higher macular pigment is associated with higher academic achievement among school children. You can look into a kid\'s eyes and get some sense of how well they may do in subjects like math and writing. This finding is important because macular lutein is modifiable and can be manipulated by dietary intake. OK, OK, so where is lutein found? The avocado and egg industries like to boast about how much of these macular pigments they have in their products, but the real superstars are dark green leafy vegetables. A half cup of kale has 50 times more than an egg, a spinach salad, or a 50-egg omelet? And the earlier the better. Pregnant and breastfeeding women should definitely be checking off my Daily Dozen greens servings. But it\'s also apparently never too late. While some age-related cognitive decline is to be expected, these effects may be less pronounced among those eating more green and leafy, but you don\'t know for sure until you put it to the test, which we\'ll explore next.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'What is the best source of lutein, the primary carotenoid antioxidant in the brain?\n\nWhat about just taking lutein supplements?

However, it\'s only now becoming clear that the consumption of diets rich in plant foods can influence neuro- inflammation, brain inflammation, leading to the expression of cytoprotective, cell protective, and restorative proteins. Just over the last decade, remarkable progress has been made to realize that oxidative stress and chronic, low-grade inflammation, are major risk factors underlying brain aging, so no wonder antioxidant and anti-inflammatory foods may help. The brain is especially vulnerable to free radical attack, oxidative stress, due to its high fat content and its cauldron of high metabolic activity. You don\'t want your brains to go rancid. So you\'d think one of the major fat-soluble dietary antioxidants like beta-carotene would step in, but the major carotenoid concentrated in the brain is actually lutein; the brain just preferentially sucks it up. For example, if you  look at the oldest old, like in the Georgia centenarian study, recognizing that oxidation is involved in age-related cognitive decline, they figured dietary antioxidants may play a role in its prevention or delay, so they looked at eight different ones, vitamin A, vitamin E, on down the list, and only lutein was significantly related to better cognition. Now in this study they looked at brain tissue on autopsy. By then it\'s a little too late. So how could you study the effects of diet on the brain while you\'re still alive? If only there was a way we could physically look into the living brain with  our own two eyes. There is! With our own two eyes. The retina, the back of our eyeball, is actually an extension of our central nervous system, an outpouching of the brain during development, and right in the middle there\'s a spot. This is what the doctor sees when they look into your eye with that bright light. That spot, called the macula, is our HD camera, where you get the highest resolution vision, and it\'s packed with lutein. And indeed, levels in the retina correspond to levels in the rest of your brain, so your eyes can be a window into your brain. So now we can finally do studies on live people to see if diet can affect lutein levels in the eyes, which reflects lutein levels in the brain, and see if that correlates with improvements in cognitive function. And indeed, significant correlations exist between the amount of macular pigment, these plant pigments like lutein in your eye, and cognitive test scores. You can demonstrate this on functional MRI scans, suggesting lutein and a related plant pigment called zeaxanthin promote cognitive functioning in old age by enhancing neural efficiency, the efficiency by which our nerves communicate. Like check out this cool study on white matter integrity using something called diffusion tensor imaging, which provides unique insights into brain network connectivity, allowing you to follow the nerve tracts throughout the brain. And researchers were able to show enhanced circuit integrity based on how much lutein and zeaxanthin they could see in people\'s eyes— further evidence of a meaningful relationship between diet and integrity of our brains, particularly in regions vulnerable to age-related decline. So do Alzheimer\'s patients have less of this macular pigment? Significantly less lutein in their eyes, significantly less lutein in their blood, and a higher occurrence of macular degeneration, where this pigment layer gets destroyed. The thickness of this plant pigment layer in your eyes can be measured and may be a potential marker for the beginnings of Alzheimer\'s. Let\'s not wait that long, though. We know macular pigment density is related to cognitive function in older people. What about during middle age?

However, little evidence on its role in human brain function existed... until it was put to the test. Feed people lots of green leafy vegetables with some beet juice to boot, and then measure cerebral blood flow. See that spot there with improved flow? That’s a critical brain area known to be involved in executive functioning. OK, but improved blood flow doesn’t necessarily translate into improved cognitive function. For example, feed people tart cherries, and despite some indication of improved blood flow, this didn’t appear to manifest as improved cognitive performance. And indeed, some of the initial studies were disappointing. Give people over a cup of cooked spinach and no immediate boost in the ability to carry out simple tasks, but that may be because the tests weren’t hard enough. Give people a similar battery of simple tasks after consuming cocoa and no significant effect. But put people through a more demanding set of tasks, and you can see acute improvements in cognitive performance after cocoa consumption. The tasks they’re talking about is like counting backwards in 3’s for minutes at a time. What if you tried doing that same thing after drinking two cups of organic beet juice, which has about the same amount of nitrate as two cups of cooked arugula? Significantly improved performance, in terms of more correct answers on the sustained subtraction task. These results suggest that a single dose of nitrate-rich vegetables can modify brain function, and that this is likely to be as a result of increased nitric oxide synthesis. OK,  but how do we know it’s the nitrate? Beets are packed with all sorts of phytonutrients like the betalain red pigment. One way to tease it out would be to come up with some kind of nitrate- depleted beet juice— has all the other stuff in beets, but just missing the nitrate— to see if that works just as well, and that’s exactly what researchers did. They developed a nitrate- depleted beetroot juice placebo. And compared to that, within two weeks of supplementation with the real stuff this group of diabetics got a significant improvement in reaction time. Now we’re just talking 13 milliseconds here, but other interventions like balance training that only increased reaction time like 7 milliseconds were associated with significantly lower fall risk. And of course, in athletes, those fractions of a second can sometimes make a difference. At very high exercise intensities, cognitive task performance deteriorates, with a pronounced detrimental effect on reaction time, and that may be just when you need it the most. Like you\'re playing football or something and need to make rapid appropriate decisions while simultaneously going all out. And once again, beets to the rescue, significantly reducing reaction time; so, not only improving physical performance but mental performance as well. Yeah, but can it improve the structure of your brain? Things like cognitive training and aerobic exercise can actually affect the structure of the human brain. There’s something called neuroplasticity, where your brain can adapt, changing its configuration as you like learn to play piano or something. We used to think only younger brains could do this, but now we know it can occur in the aging brain as well. Can’t “beet” that—or can you? We didn\'t know… until now. Here’s your brain before and after a six-week exercise program, measuring connectivity between various parts of your brain that control movement. No big change. But, what about the same amount of exercise before… and after drinking some beet juice too? Big difference. The exercise plus beetroot juice group developed brain networks that more closely resembled those of younger adults, showing the potential enhanced neuroplasticity conferred by combining exercise and nitrate-rich vegetables.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Every month I go live from my treadmill to answer your questions here on YouTube and on Facebook.

organization that runs nutrition facts that are if you would like to support my work please consider making a tax-deductible donation we are currently at let me we're in eighty nine point nine four percent let me refresh though hold on hold on nineteen point one nine percent all right we are but 9.81% to go to hit our data our goal by the end of the year so we are down to the wire hopefully you will help us out if you value what we do in nutrition facts are everything is free obviously no ads no corporate sponsorship strictly non-commercial not to sell anything just put up as a public service it's a labor of love as a tribute to my grandmother who's the reason that I do look what I do alright let us get to questions here all right here we go all right questions are pouring in I'll start with the top Oliver Hawk I asked what's the function Oh what's the function of the appendix Balaji teacher told me used to be for heavy plant digestion but due to switch to an omnivore kind of lost its function that is a good question we are not actually sure what the appendix is for but it is packed with immune tissue lymphoid tissue and so we think it may have something to do with immune function but certainly Berkut known as Berkut the famous one of our most famous medical figures of the last century for which burkas lymphoma is named after he's also well known for his his the fiber theory we talked about the well fiber may play in preventing some of the chronic diseases that were plaguing the Western world but were missing from the missionary hospitals they spent a lot of time from in sub-saharan Africa where he didn't find these epidemics of heart disease and obesity and diabetes and colon cancer and on down the list and appendicitis was actually one on those lists and thinks that that little if in cases of pendous itis you often find a it's called a fecal if a little stone of compacted feces blocking the entrance or the exit to the appendix and that's thought to cause the inflammation and so freed so maybe that's the reason why people eat high fiber diets who have more who have softer larger stool less constipation have lower rates of appendicitis who knows um I actually have a video coming up in on on fasting as a treatment for appendicitis for who they don't want to go into surgery not something I recommend but interesting case report as part of my long extended fasting series but that's enough on appendix thank you for your question um oh it's probably not Oliver probably Olivier sorry about that um Asik years so just says thanks Oh Olivier also says nearsightedness is less son to blame before our nearsightedness is there foods that may help with myopia it's a good question never looked into it um maybe because I couldn't see no um why is nearsightedness increasing I don't know good question I figured a pubmed.gov the database the largest medical library in the world and type in the myopia which is the kind named for your sadness and diet maybe you can find something and I'll do a video about it alright Olivier had was ready to go with all his questions as soon as the thing started smart person and next question was kissing girl kissing girlfriend causes irritation dry skin pimples ohh due to due to his stubbles idea of a treatment or prevention it's called shaving maybe and two more questions from Olivier do you have a database showing which paper oh oh which patient with papers you evaluated and tagged them um with various tags I mean I do have a database of all day let's see how bit I mean these are just the papers collected for 2017 which let's see there are high the database is sixty one point six one gig 75,000 177 PDFs but they are tagged but they're categorized not by by industry bias but by subject matter and finally Olivier says can't find much on whole food plant-based I had insisting fibrosis in the literature what do you think I only think what the literature says testing literature then I've got no opinion in fact I have no opinion about stuff in literature's just in the literature it's not um ah and though I haven't done specifically a search for cystic fibrosis and diet if anyone does find anything I would love to offer my advice on that not my advice just presenting the data in hopes that it might help somebody Chloe says maybe you can get me to talk about intermittent fasting ah interesting third person there I to talk about intermittent fasting I just haven't finished all my research on it so that's why I hesitate to talk but there is a huge boatload of data and looking forward to doing lots of videos about it Shauna asks oh isn't Shauna like Indian for chickpea I don't know maybe that's just I know well what a great name can you get all the omegas you need just with plant food such as Fox to Chia right there are two essential fats I'll make you threes make sixes make sixes basically found everywhere um so that's not a problem but make it threes in fact people get a lot to MIT to many mega sixes from these junky oils and processed foods like seed oil um but but we need our mega threes I mean that's something you could be relatively efficient in and most concentrated source and mega threes are our flax seeds in fact I'm just working on some flexi videos or all right now those I was doing this morning um flax seeds chia seeds walnuts hemp seeds I'm dirty vegetables have some even though that I'm a lot of fat but so but and so that is the short chain omega-3 called ethnic acid which our bodies can elongate into the long-chain omega-3s EPA & DHA the question is can it elongated enough for optimum health it's an unanswered research question about a bunch of videos about it I'm a but basically bottom line is may want to supplement you die with launched preformed long-chain omega-3s and not rely particularly as we get older on our body making enough for optimal cognitive health so I would recommend 250 milligrams of EPA in our DHA a day from pollutant free sources meaning algae based sources all right I said years raw vegan recovery asks what is my new book oh um so um how not to die cookbook just came out uh and hit the number 300 your Times bestsellers very very excited thanks to all your pre-orders um and so hopefully supposed lots of new people to eating healthy or eating evidence-based and so but my next book which going to start writing in March and currently a buffering out enough videos to be able to take off a year to write it on is going to be on obesity called how not to diet and looking very much forward to sitting down and working on that but it's just a massive project that's just I think there's 80,000 articles a year on obesity alone and so that's like that's a lot and so every day that goes by I get farther and farther behind so looking forward to jumping on that but I've got to do all the videos first how can we come up with this new compelling content all the time new video articles every day it's because we have hundreds literally hundreds of volunteers but we also have over a dozen paid staff that cost a lot of money and it's all just donation base kind of like Wikipedia everything's free but we count on the donations of people that just want to support our work feel it's useful for them valuable so you mean if 1000 people kicks in a few bucks we'd be all set since we reach so many millions of people even a dollar can help please got a nutrition facts that are click on the donate button we'd love your donations any time of the year this is just our final end of your push to get us set up for next year anyway alright next we did Chloe be there ok ochart is back saying mother worried about siblings missing nutrients from animal products can I give her a clear mind um and so there are only two vitamins um not made by animals well not made by plants um one is vitamin D made by animal such as yourself when you walk outside and get enough Sun at this time of the year though and the high enough in northern hemisphere the sun's rays err it's such an angle that I mean I'd be making enough vitamin D so I didn't curse mm unless you use a vitamin do you day regardless of what you eat and the other bother vitamin not made by plants is vitamin b12 norm a man will see there may have a little microbes that blink at the earth uh we may have been able to get all the b12 we need drinking out of a mountain stream of well water or something but not we chlorinated our water supply kill off any bacteria so don't get a lot of b12 in our water anymore don't get a lot of color either that's a good thing such a nice sanitary world but but it's critically important anyone eating a plant-based diet to get a regular reliable source of vitamin b12 our fellow great apes get all the b12 they need eating bugs dirt and feces I prefer a supplement so twenty-five hundred micrograms Bionicle bomb and chips for my b12 one so we gots less than five bucks here get all the b12 you need and there you go all right um Julia asks what foods are best for the brain how can I best keep my green healthy berries berries for the berries for the wind and so there was you know this famous Harvard nurses study I found that berry eaters it's just a few servings a week of blueberries or strawberries though women eating berries compared to non berry eaters or infrequent very eaters had a delay had their basically their their cognitive function was two and a half years younger so they kind of delayed brain aging by two and a half years that was an observational study though I'm so it's possible maybe berry eaters were just healthier in""), Document(metadata={'description': 'The consumption of blueberries and strawberries is associated with delayed cognitive aging by as much as 2.5 years, thought to be because of brain-localizing anthocyanin phytonutrients, as shown on functional MRI scans.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Two of the most dreaded consequences  of dementia with aging  are problems moving around and  difficulty remembering things.  Dementia robs older adults of their  independence, control, and identity.  What can we  do about it? Well, fruits and vegetables help reduce  the risk of other chronic diseases, might they work for  brain diseases as well?  There has been a proliferation  of recent interest in plant polyphenols as agents  in the treatment of dementia.  There are 4,000 different  kinds found ubiquitously  in foods of plant origin,  but berries are packed with them,  possessing powerful antioxidant,  anti-inflammatory properties,  and there’s a subset of a  subset called anthocyanidins,  natural blue-purple pigments  uniquely and specifically capable  of both crossing the  blood–brain barrier  and localizing inside brain regions  involved in learning and memory.  And that’s where  we need it. The brain takes up less than  like 2% of the body weight, but may burn up to 50%  of the body’s fuel,  creating a potential  firestorm of free radicals. So maybe these brain-seeking  phytonutrients in berries  could fight oxidation, inflammation,  and increase blood flow. So, this raised a  thought-provoking idea.  Maybe a nutritional intervention  with blueberries  may be beneficial in forestalling  or even reversing  the neurological changes  associated with aging.  So did researchers give blueberries  to people and see what happened?  No, as I noted in an earlier video,  they gave blueberries to rats.  It would be a decade before  the first human trial. But it worked!  ""Blueberry Supplementation  Improves Memory in Older Adults""  suggesting that consistent  supplementation with blueberries  may offer an approach  to forestall or mitigate  brain degeneration  with age. What other blue/purple  foods can we try?  Concord grape juice  had a similar benefit, improving verbal  learning,  suggesting that supplementation  with purple grape juice  may enhance cognitive function in  older adults with early memory decline.  Why use juice and not  whole concord grapes?  Because then you couldn’t  design a placebo that looked and tasted  exactly the same  to rule out the very real  and powerful placebo effect. And also, because it was funded by  the Welch’s grape juice company. This effect was confirmed  in a follow-up study ,  showing for the first time an  increase in neural activation in parts of the brain associated with  memory using functional MRI scans. But this brain scan study was  tiny, just 4 people in each group.  And same problem in  the blueberry study –  it just had 9  people in it. Why haven’t large population-based  studies been done?  Because we haven’t  had good databases  on where these  phytonutrients are found. We know how much vitamin C  is in a blueberry,  but not how much  anthocyanidin, ...until now.  The Harvard Nurse’s Health Study  followed the cognitive function of  more than 16,000 women for years,  and found that higher, long-term  consumption of berries  was associated with significantly  slower rates of cognitive decline  in this cohort  of older women, even after careful consideration of  confounding by socioeconomic status,  meaning even after taking into account the  fact that rich people eat more berries. The first population-based  evidence that greater intakes  of blueberries and strawberries  were highly associated  with slower rates  of cognitive decline,  and not just by  a little bit.  The magnitude of associations  were equivalent to the cognitive differences  that one might observe in women up to 2 and a  half years apart in age. In other words, women with  higher intake of berries  appeared to have delayed cognitive  aging by as much as 2 1/2 years. Why not just take some kind of  anthocyanidin supplement?  Because there hasn’t been a single study  that found any kind of cognitive benefit  just giving these single  phytonutrients. In fact the opposite.  Whole blueberries appear to be more  effective than individual components,  showing that the whole is greater  than the sum of its parts.

In my last video I talked about the risks associated with proton pump inhibitor drugs like Nexium, as well as folk remedies like baking soda. So, all in all, studies have emphasized the unmet need for medications to treat patients with dyspepsia, but why not try food? One study put amalaki to the test, which is just another name for amla. They call it an Ayurvedic drug, but it’s just a fruit—powdered Indian gooseberries. One teaspoon of dried Indian gooseberry powder three times a day versus an ounce of some gel antacid every three hours. And both worked just as well, significant decreases in peak acid output, and a cutting of dyspepsia symptom scores in half. They conclude that amla is therefore better, about a hundred times cheaper (about a penny a week instead of a dollar a week), and more convenient than downing antacids six times a day. Though amla may be a safe, simple, natural remedy, such an approach is still very much in the pharmaceutical model of treating the symptoms, rather than the underlying cause. I mean dyspepsia is not caused by a gooseberry deficiency. What is it caused by? Well, about one in seven people describing a range of gastrointestinal symptoms feel better cutting out gluten, but for the other 86% of people, the most well-characterized trigger is high fat meals. If you give people a fatty soup— just broth with added fat— it takes three times longer to empty from your stomach compared to the broth alone, like an hour and a half versus just a half an hour. Now the emptying rate didn’t necessarily correlate with how people felt, but regardless, the fatty broth increased the severity and frequency of dyspepsia over the regular broth. What happens in dyspepsia is people become hypersensitive to the stretching of the stomach when you eat. But, it also matters what you eat. The human stomach can normally accommodate about a quart of food, a thousand milliliters, four cups, but if you stick a balloon into people’s stomachs attached to a hose, people with dyspepsia will start feeling discomfort about here, only at about one- and-a-half cups, when the stomach is less than half full. But that’s when you’re dripping fat into their gut, but if you\'re instead dripping sugar into their gut while you’re blowing up the balloon, it can get up to here before causing discomfort in dyspeptics- about 70% more. And the same with fullness and nausea. Increase the pressure in the stomach with fat in there, and fullness and nausea shoot up. With fake fat in your stomach instead, the same pressures resulted in significantly less feelings of fullness and nausea. These studies show that during distension of the stomach as the stomach fills up— dietary fats are a major trigger of dyspeptic symptoms such as nausea, pain, bloating, and fullness, and they modulate symptoms in a dose-related fashion, meaning more fat the worse people felt. These were some pretty elegant experiments, but also a bit artificial. I mean we don’t typically eat with balloons in our stomach. So how about an experiment using actual food? They compared yogurts high in sugar/low in fat, versus high in fat/low in sugar. Eating the low-fat yogurt there wasn’t as much difference in the nausea, pain, and bloating scores between those with dyspepsia and healthy subjects. But give them the same amount of high-fat yogurt, and dyspepsia symptoms shot up almost immediately. So, one of our major findings was that the induction of gastrointestinal symptoms after the test meals were “nutrient-specific.” The consumption of a high- fat test meal was associated with a substantially greater increase in nausea and pain when compared to a high-carbohydrate meal among those with dyspepsia, with the symptoms scores increasing immediately after eating. This would suggest that sufferers not only reduce the amount of food they eat, which is the typical advice, but also try to keep the fat content down, a message echoed by a recent review of all such studies put together. Current studies show that fatty foods are associated with occurrence of dyspeptic symptoms, and reduction of fat intake may help alleviate symptoms.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'What to avoid and what to eat to help with dyspepsia.\n\nWhat about just popping a pill instead?

More than what we touch or breathe, what we eat is our largest exposure to the outside world. Normally, our entire gastro-intestinal tract is impervious to what is inside of it, allowing our body to pick and choose what comes in or out. But there are things that may make our gut leaky, and chief among them is our diet. What happens is the Standard American Diet can cause gut dysbiosis, meaning a disruption in our gut microbiome, which can lead to intestinal inflammation and a leaky intestinal barrier. Then tiny bits of undigested food, microbes, and toxins can slip uninvited through our gut lining into our bloodstream and trigger chronic systemic inflammation. To avoid this dysbiosis and intestinal inflammation, plants should be preferred. Vegetarian diet gut bacteria are associated with intestinal microbiome balance, high bacterial biodiversity, and integrity of the intestinal barrier. They tend to suffer from markedly fewer uremic toxins, like indole and p-cresol, and because fiber is the primary food for our gut microbiome, the gut bacteria of those eating plant-based diets produce more of the good stuff, the short-chain fatty acids that fulfill a protective and nourishing role for the cells lining our gut, ensuring the preservation of the intestinal barrier. Plant fiber is of prime importance to the preservation of the intestinal barrier integrity, but you can\'t know for sure until you put it to the test. People were given whole grains, beans and lentils, fruits, vegetables, and nuts and seeds, and got a significant reduction in zonulin levels. Zonulin is a protein responsible for the disassembling of the tight junctions between gut lining cells, and so it\'s a biomarker that reflects an impairment of the intestinal barrier. In other words, zonulin is considered to be a useful marker of a leaky gut. But since adding all those plants seemed to lower levels, that may imply that appropriate fiber intake helps to maintain the proper structure and function of the intestinal barrier. But whole healthy plant foods have a lot more than fiber. How do we know it\'s the fiber? And the study didn\'t even have a control group. That\'s why they say gut permeability might be improved by dietary fiber. To prove cause-and-effect, it\'d be nice to have a randomized double-blind crossover study where you compare the effect of the same food with or without fiber, and here we go. People were randomized to pasta, with or without added fiber, and there was a significant drop in zonulin levels in the added fiber group, so fiber does appear to improve gut leakiness. Any plant foods in particular that may help? Curcumin, the yellow pigment in the spice turmeric, can help prevent the intestinal damage done by ibuprofen-type drugs, but that\'s in rats. Similar protection was noted for the broccoli compound sulforaphane, but that was in mice. No human studies on broccoli yet, but there was a study on three days of the equivalent of about 2 to 3 teaspoons a day of turmeric, which did reduce the gastrointestinal barrier damage caused by exercise. Less may work, too, but no smaller doses have been put to the test. If you ask alternative medicine practitioners what treatments they use for a leaky gut, #1 on the list, after reducing alcohol consumption, is zinc. Zinc doesn\'t just protect against aspirin-like drug-induced damage in rats. When put to the test in a randomized trial of humans, the same thing was found. The NSAID drug indomethacin caused a three-fold rise in gut permeability as one would expect from that class of drugs, but when they were also taking zinc, this prevented the rise in permeability, strongly suggesting a small intestinal protective effect. The dose they used was  massive though: 75 mg a day; that\'s nearly twice the tolerable upper daily limit for zinc. What about getting zinc just at regular food doses? There was a significant improvement in gut leakiness even with a dose of just three milligrams of zinc, suggesting that even relatively low zinc supplementation may work. You can get the three extra milligrams of zinc in your daily diet eating a cup of cooked lentils.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Is low FODMAP the best diet for SIBO symptoms?

In infancy we have an enzyme in our small intestines that digests milk sugar, but most of us understandably lose it after weaning. Although a genetic mutation has led to the persistence of the enzyme in a minority of adults, about 75% of the world\'s population malabsorb lactose and have lactose intolerance after age 30. A third, though, were diagnosed with SIBO: Small Intestinal Bacterial Overgrowth. The evidence for SIBO and IBS symptoms is shrouded in controversy, predominantly because of the fact that the breath tests used in clinical practice to diagnose SIBO are not valid, as I explored in the last video. And it\'s not even clear what the implications are of having more versus less bacteria growing in your small intestine since the number don\'t seem to correlate with symptoms. It turns out it\'s not the number, but the type. It\'s the kind of bugs you have growing in your small intestine. So it\'s small intestinal microbial dysbiosis, not overgrowth in general, but the wrong kind of growth that appears to underlie symptoms associated with functional gastrointestinal disorders like irritable bowel syndrome. How can you prevent this from happening? Well, the symptoms appeared be correlated to a significant drop in the number of Prevotella species. Remember them? Prevotella are healthy fiber feeders, suggestive of a higher fiber intake in healthy individuals, while the bugs found more in symptomatic patients ate sugar, which may reflect a higher dietary intake of sugars. Yes, but correlation doesn\'t mean causation. To prove cause and effect you have to put it to the test, which is exactly what they did. Switching a group of healthy individuals who habitually ate a higher fiber diet to a more typical standard American low fiber diet with lots of sugar produced striking results within just seven days. First, 80% developed new gastrointestinal symptoms out of the blue, such as bloating and abdominal pain that resolved on resumption of their more healthful, habitual higher fiber diet. And the diet related changes in the small intestinal microbiome were predictive of symptoms and linked to an alteration in intestinal permeability; in other words, they developed a leaky gut within seven days. And while some went from SIBO positive to SIBO negative, or SIBO negative to SIBO positive, it didn\'t matter, since the number of bacteria growing didn\'t correlate with symptoms. It was the type of bacteria growing. And no wonder their guts got leaky. Short-chain fatty acid levels plummeted. Those are the magical by-products that our good gut bugs make from fiber, which play an important role in intestinal barrier integrity, meaning keeping our gut from getting leaky. So while we don\'t have sound data that something like a low FODMAP diet has any benefit for SIBO-symptom patients, there have been more than a dozen randomized controlled trials putting fiber to the test, and overall there was a significant improvement in symptoms among those randomized to increase their fiber intake. That may actually help explain why high-fiber, plant-based diets may prevent so many common diseases — the effect such diets have on the composition and metabolic activity of our microbiome. Our good gut bugs take the plant residues like fiber and produce health-promoting and cancer-suppressing metabolites like those short-chain fatty acids which have profound anti-inflammatory properties. All the evidence points to a physiological need for about 50 grams of fiber a day, which is the amount contained in the traditional African diet and associated with the prevention of westernized diseases. That\'s approximately twice what\'s typically recommended and three times more than what most people are getting day-to-day. Perhaps it should be no surprise we need so much. Even though we split from chimpanzees millions of years ago, there\'s still broad congruency in the composition of our respective microbiomes to this day. While they\'re still eating their 98-99% plant-based diets to feed their friendly flora with fiber, we\'ve largely removed fiber-rich foods from our food supply.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Replay of Dr. Greger's live Q&A, January 2024. \n\n0:00 Introduction\n\n1:30 Do all forms of choline cause prostate cancer?\n\n1:50 Is it true that women with breast cancer should not eat whole grains and eat only low glycemic foods to avoid inflammation?\n\n2:05 Any probiotic/food suggestions to help with dermatitis?\n\n2:25 Should you eat something while eating your daily spices or just drink water?\n\n2:41 What specific brand of omega-3 do you recommend?

minutes late I um uh I would just gave a webinar a a this is so cool a a book club for how not to age it's four weeks uh so there's still three more to go so if you missed it um I had a lot of fun I think it was great um packed a lot of great information um but you can still sign up for the other three webinars oh I wonder if I have that somewhere uh I wish I had a URL for you oh oh um yeah I don't have the webinar anyway go to nutritionfacts.org go to the top click down on webinars and sign up for the uh for the book club um anyway for those of you unfamiliar with my work every year I read through every issue of every English language nutrition Journal of the world so busy folks like you don't have to I then compile the most interesting most groundbreaking most practic findings to

not selling anything just put up as a public service as a labor of love as a tribute to my grandma and as you can see I have my lucky broccoli tie on today let's go to your questions oh you can tell I'm I'm two minutes late because there's lots of questions queued up okay um uh first question oh does not show up on oh there it is sorry can't see it first question do all forms of choline um cause prostate cancer it's more like contributing to prostate cancer all concentrated forms of choline but that's mostly just eggs all right um next up is it true that women with breast cancer um should only eat whole grains and only eat low glycemic foods to avoid inflammation it's good for everyone to stick to whole grains and eat low glycemic load Foods right um uh my 11 month old subar dermatitis on the scalp yeah using uh these things any probiotic food SS you know I don't know anything that I have not run across any foods that help with subaric dermititis last time I checked but I will um I will do another run next time I do a series of videos next up should you eat something while eating your oh oh that's this fun that's funny this question here this person asked this exact same question in the webinar today um uh I encourage people to eat their spices with a meal okay what specific brand of Omega-3s they're all made by the same company um the the alga based omega3 just uh sold under different brand names so buy whatever is cheapest should I been worried about gust gum I think you mean guar gum and sodium bicarbonate in plant-based um milks no um uh yeah I think G gum's okay I know locust bean gum is it's the caragan that we're concerned about okay do I still recommend a daily dose of a teaspoon of Salon cinnamon oh oh sure why not that sounds great um yeah antioxidant Rich does all sorts of wonderful things yeah I'm down you can mix with your cocoa powder um I recommend a tablespoon of of natural cocoa powder every day um and how not to age and you could add some cinnamon as well as cardamom to it what is the solution for high hemoglobin oh oh okay high hemoglobin what does the blood dation help if Mo is very active what is the cause okay so um uh this is uh um what is the solution for high hemoglobin so this is something like polycythemia very you can have too many red blood cells in your body and so you can do blood donations which is basically like the one of the few conditions that actually blood leting would actually help with um and it's so you may actually have polycythemia um that's the cause your body's making too many um red blood cells is there anything you can do besides blood donations you need to talk to your hon doctor um I don't know anything uh you can do on a dietary basis is ch mixed with water well absorbed source of Omega-3s no you got you got to grind it up um but ground Gia mixed with water certainly would be is papal pepper as potent as normal pepper to increase turmeric no it's completely different uh um different plant and I do not know that it diminishes the ability of your detoxifying enzymes which is what black pepper does um it suppresses your detox enzyme so your body um uh doesn't get rid of as much curcumin um and how much papali is necessary for CTIC effects we don't know as I talk about in the book um we don't know if we can even achieve the sentic levels in our bloodstream because it's never been put to the test oh this poor person Brian tore there right Achilles surgically repaired which by eating to Aid healing well you know um uh increasing your protein intake can help with wound healing uh um vitamin C zinc um just basically eating a really healthy diet but the one thing you know particularly if you're recovering from like major surgery um increasing your protein intake can help with healing okay are naturally occurring trans fats and animal products like meat and dairy as bad harmful as Hydra and oils yes it is I have a video about that how bad is to eat small quantities of low trans fat cheeses um um such as parmesan and mozzarella the big problem about parmesan is the oxidized cholesterol I have a video about that um I don't know how much trans fat is in mozzarella um but we do know it has lots of saturated fat saturated butter fat which is not good for the same reason that we avoid trans fats increasing our cardiovascular risk what if I implemented all the rec spice and Herb recommendations what I would end up with 30 grams of spices a day is that still healthy I don't think that's true really 30 grams no I just like a quar teaspoon of turmeric how many grams is that like one gram uh4 teaspoon of black black cumin one or two grams uh4 teaspoon of like ginger powder that's a gram or two4 teaspoon what's the other one amla that's a gram or two so maybe five grams yeah three grams yeah I don't know where you're getting that from unless you consider like cocoa powder spice in which case yeah tablespoon would add up a little bit does ALT restriction oh does salt restriction raise triglycerides Ender cholesterol no salt restriction should um lower your blood pressure um but I don't think it affects the amount of fat in your blood start start eating dogs start eating dogs they're necessary for health humans have always eaten dogs and some people who eat dogs haven't diet yet therefore it's essential and healthy I have no idea what Eaton huart is talking about um him though says uh uh spelling my name wrong uh loves my book though so completely uh it's okay you spell my name all you want um I got the book audio version Oh that was brutal 30 hours of recording do I recommend making plant milk at home no I just buy it it's so much cheaper um uh I mean not it's probably not cheaper in the long run but it's more convenient um what do I think of making plant milk plant mil makers great uh but I just I don't I've I just don't got the bandwidth for it so I just get unsweetened soy milk my favorite brand is the Whole Foods generic brand 365 or whatever just because I like the taste uh what's the maximum daily dosage of ashwagandha um oh I talk about um staying away from Ashu Ganda right which is um comes from the words for wet horse because it's supposedly smells like a wet horse but anyway yeah because of the liver damage I encourage people to stay away from it in my latest book you can look in the index and look at the ashwaganda section to recommend four Brazil nuts once a month uh yeah why not give it a try see if it lowers your all cholesterol like that too good to be true study did well methods are best for cooking tofu I would use moist methods um as opposed to like blackened Cajun tofu or something because the high dry heat methods can actually cause a formation of Ages which we typically only seen with um you know broiled or baked or barbecued meat is Chu good for ampk no um not that I know of um uh but you can boost ampk with spermine so eat some Tempe some green peas some mushrooms some wheat yarm and you can boost that top you that way or exercise for 60 minutes a day moderate intensity bris walking that's another good way to do it how not to AG is great says Fernanda that's very nice I'm so glad um colon cancer screening oh yeah yeah yeah what recommend what method do I recommend or plan to undergo I did the colig guard um like it's a DNA like cancer DNA testing thing it's a stool testing kit so you get it in the mail you send back a sample and they tell you if they think you have colon cancer or not and you do that every three years so I just did it for the second time right because yeah you're supposed to get it done at um uh starting at age 45 and I'm negative twice thank God okay what's next what brands of bread do I recommend well the B the worst thing about bread lots of bad things about bread but probably it's high sodium content it's probably the number one source of sodium for people over age 50 I believe believe um chicken is the number one source between 20 and 50 and pizza is under 20 if I remember correctly um so it's hard to find bread without added salt but Ezekiel Bread there's an Ezekiel bread that without added salt made out of sprouted grains that would probably be healthiest Michelle Lewis which is me Whole Food BL base aggravates gird and IBS why how can I counter the effects hope BL Bas should not aggravate gird I have a whole um video on gir there's lots things you can do for decreasing acid reflux I encourage you to check it out um and IBS so I I mean I I I would presume that a high fiber die would actually help with IBS but in that transition period you can get IBS like symptoms like bloating and excessive gas um uh uh because you don't have the microbial Machinery to deal with the amount of fiber which your body was really meant to deal with and so I encourage people to um to If you experience those symptoms when you start eating healthier to""), Document(metadata={'description': 'Hypersensitivity reactions to dairy

Also, you can try smaller more frequent feedings, thickening or changing formulas, and in breastfed infants (which is ideally how all infants should be) eliminating cow’s milk and eggs from the mother’s diet. I’ve talked about how more than 40 percent of infants with reflux can be successfully treated with cow’s milk removal. It can also affect them on the other end too— can be a major contributor to diaper rash, and contribute to chronic constipation in 80 percent of affected kids, though only a single kid tested positive for an actual cow’s milk allergy. So, it was like some kind of sensitivity reaction that can really only be diagnosed by giving a cow’s milk-free diet a try. Anal fissures in infants may be practically pathognomonic for cow’s milk allergy, meaning so characteristic of the condition that it could be used as a diagnostic sign, no allergy testing required. It’s like when cow milk hypersensitivity was demonstrated in 10 of 17 children with severe reflux. In the majority of patients, the hypersensitivity to cow milk was identified only by eliminating it and then re-challenging to confirm. They did endoscopies, measured the acid gurgling up before and after milk, and then verified by repeating milk exposure with double-blind placebo-controlled challenges when necessary. Yet, all but one of the children proven to have this adverse reaction to dairy tested negative on allergy tests. So, tested negative for a cow’s milk allergy, but still got better by cutting the cow’s milk out, showing that this association between cow milk hypersensitivity and severe GERD, this severe reflux, was observed not only in infants but also in older children. Another disease that can be cured with cow’s milk elimination is eosinophilic esophagitis, a chronic inflammatory disorder of the esophagus (the tube that connects the mouth to the stomach). To figure out what’s causing the inflammation, an elimination diet is prescribed, where you basically remove everything, and then every time you add back a food they stick an endoscope down your throat and take biopsies to see if that one food made things worse. And how many freakin’ foods are there out there! So, you can imagine how difficult, and costly, and invasive this is for families, how confusing and frustrating. So, these researchers at Northwestern figured let’s just see what happens if you just remove one food from their diet instead of making them go through all that. And just eliminating cow’s milk induced remission in 65 percent of the children they tried it on. I mean normally you’d have to put these kids on steroids, where they try to coat their throat with steroids to knock down their immune response, but then that sets you up for infections like thrush; and of course, as soon as you stop the steroids the esophageal inflammation comes raging back, because you’re not treating the underlying cause. But steroids are considered the standard of care. Too bad there’s never been like a head-to-head test of cow’s milk elimination versus steroids... until now. A comparative effectiveness trial of cow’s milk elimination versus a swallowed steroid and… they both appeared to work just as well, which is to say the cow’s milk elimination worked better, because no side effects and you’re treating the actual cause, suggesting getting rid of dairy products should be considered the first-line therapy. In adolescence, cow’s milk protein intolerance can contribute to chronic fatigue syndrome, evidently a common problem in young people with chronic fatigue and most importantly a treatable contributor to their symptoms. But again, most were unaware that dairy was a problem, possibly because it can take hours between milk ingestion and when you start feeling worse, so people don’t make the connection. So, even those who report no problems after milk ingestion may still be suffering problems after milk ingestion. And finally, what about adults? Well there’s lactose intolerance. Most people on Earth are lactose intolerant after weaning, with the exception of some human populations that developed lactose tolerance about 10,000 years ago, thanks to a mutation in the lactase gene which enable adult humans to digest lactose (milk sugar). Or, at least those select European populations; whereas most Hispanics, most Africans and Asians remain intolerant, which may be a good thing, since acid regurgitation, reflux, heartburn is so common among adults in the Western world. And food intolerance may play a role in adults as well. Milk was found to be the leading culprit, but they were using what’s called a leucocytotoxic test, where you see how someone’s white blood cells react to individual foods in a petri dish. This test is frowned upon by professional allergy associations as not being sufficiently sensitive and specific. Can’t hurt, though, to put it to the test. A double blind, randomized, controlled trial performed in 38 reflux patients for which proton pump inhibitor drugs failed to completely control their symptoms. OK, well let’s give diet a try.

Watch this video to find out what those factors are. And in the next video I\'ll show you how to heal a leaky gut. ""Avoid These Foods to Prevent a Leaky Gut"" Intestinal permeability, the leakiness of our gut, may be a new target for disease prevention and therapy. With all its little folds, our intestinal barrier covers a surface of more than 4,000 square feet — that\'s bigger than a tennis court — and requires approximately 40% of our body\'s total energy expenditure to maintain. Mounting evidence implicates the disruption of intestinal barrier integrity in the development of numerous ailments such as inflammatory bowel disease. Here, researchers measured intestinal permeability using blue food coloring. It stays in your gut if you\'re healthy, but can be detected in the blood of extremely sick individuals as their gut barrier breaks down. You don\'t have to end up in the ICU to develop a leaky gut though. Simply taking some aspirin or ibuprofen can do the trick. Indeed, taking two regular aspirin, or two extra-strength aspirin just once can increase the leakiness of your gut. These results suggest even healthy individuals should be cautious with aspirin use as it may result in gastrointestinal barrier dysfunction. What about buffered aspirin? It doesn\'t make any difference: both regular aspirin and Bufferin produced multiple erosions in the inner lining of the stomach and intestines. Put a scope down people\'s throats and you can see extensive erosions and redness inside 90% of people taking aspirin or Bufferin in their recommended doses. How many hours does it take for the damage to occur? None. It happens within 5 minutes. Acetaminophen, sold as Tylenol in the U.S., would be a better choice, unless you have problems with your liver. And rather than making things better, Vitamin C supplements appeared to make the aspirin-induced increase in gut leakiness even worse. Interestingly, this may be why NSAID drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen are involved in up to 25% of food-induced anaphylaxis; in other words, increasing the odds of life-threatening food allergy attacks by more than 10-fold, presumably because these drugs increase the leakiness of the intestinal barrier, causing tiny food particles to slip into the bloodstream. Okay, but why can exercise increase risk, too? Strenuous exercise, like an hour at 70% of maximum capacity, can divert so much blood to the muscles, away from your internal organs that it can cause transient injury to your intestines, causing mild gut leakiness. But this can be aggravated if athletes take ibuprofen or any of the other NSAID drugs, which is unfortunately all too common. Alcohol can also be a risk factor for food allergy attacks for the same reason: increasing gut leakiness. But cut out the alcohol and your gut can heal up. What other dietary components can make a difference? Elevated consumption of saturated fat, which is found in meat, dairy, and junk, can cause the growth of bad bacteria, which make the rotten egg gas hydrogen sulfide, which can degrade the protective mucus layer. It is said to be clear that high fat diets, in general, negatively impact intestinal health by disrupting the intestinal barrier system through a variety of mechanisms. But most of the vast array of studies cited on the negative effects of high-fat diet on gut leakiness were done on lab animals or in a petri dish. You don\'t know for sure until you put it to the test. Rates of obesity and other cardiometabolic disorders have increased rapidly in parallel with a transition from traditional lower-fat diets to higher-fat diets. We know a disturbance in our good gut flora has been shown to be associated with a high risk of many of these same diseases. And studies using rodents suggest that a high-fat diet unbalances the microbiome and impairs the gut barrier, resulting in disease. To connect all the dots, though, we need a human interventional trial, and here we go: a 6-month randomized controlled-feeding trial on the effects of dietary fat on gut microbiota. And indeed, higher fat consumption appeared to be associated with unfavorable changes in the gut microbiome, and proinflammatory factors in the blood. And note: this wasn\'t meat and dairy. The researchers just swapped in refined carbs in place of refined fats, like white rice and white flour for oil. These findings suggest countries westernizing their diets should advise against increasing intakes of dietary fat, while countries that have already adopted westernized diets should consider cutting down. So far, we\'ve discussed things to prevent a leaky gut. What about foods to heal a leaky gut? That\'s what we\'ll cover next.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Straining at stool over time may force part of the stomach up into the chest, contributing to GERD acid reflux disease.

One typically thinks of fiber helping out much lower in the digestive tract. A systematic review and meta-analysis found a highly significant protective association between esophageal adenocarcinoma and dietary fiber intake, suggesting that individuals with the highest fiber intakes have an approximately 30% lower risk of cancer. This could be because of the phytates in high fiber foods slowing cancer growth. It could be the anti-inflammatory effects. Fiber could be removing carcinogens. But those are all generic anti-cancer effects of whole plant foods. Specific to this type of acid irritation induced esophageal cancer, fiber may decrease the risk of reflux in the first place. But how? Hiatus hernia occurs when part of the stomach is pushed up through the diaphragm into the chest cavity, which makes it easy for acid to reflux up into the esophagus and throat. It affects more than 1 in 5 American adults. In contrast, in rural African communities that were eating their traditional plant-based diets, it wasn\'t 1 in 5; it was closer to 1 in a 1,000 -- almost unheard of. It\'s almost peculiar to those who consume western-type diets. Why are plant-based populations protected? Perhaps because they pass such large soft stools, three or four times the volume as Westerners. What does the size and consistency of one\'s bowel movement have to do with hiatal hernia? A simple model may help illustrate the mechanism producing upward herniation of the stomach through the hole in the diaphragm that separates the abdomen from the chest called the esophageal hiatus; that\'s the opening. If a ball with a hole in it is filled with water and then squeezed, the water is pushed out through the hole. The abdominal cavity  may be likened to a ball, the hole in the ball corresponding to that esophageal hiatus in the diaphragm. So abdominal straining during efforts to evacuate firm feces corresponds to squeezing the ball and may result in gradual expulsion of the upper end of the stomach from the abdominal cavity up into the chest. It\'s like when you squeeze one of those stress balls. Straining at stool raises pressures inside our abdominal cavity more than almost any other factor. When we bear down and strain at stool, it\'s like squeezing our abdomen, and may herniate part of our stomach up. Consistent with this concept is the observation that in Africans the lower esophageal sphincter is entirely sub-diaphragmatic, whereas it usually straddles the diaphragm in Westerners and is above the diaphragm in the presence of hiatus hernia. And the same abdominal pressure from straining that may cause hiatal hernias may cause a number of other problems. The straining can cause herniations in the wall of the colon itself, known as diverticulosis. And that same pressure can also backup blood flow into the veins around the anus, causing hemorrhoids, and push blood flow back into the legs, resulting in varicose veins as well.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""If the avoidance of sulfur-rich proteins and food additives can help prevent inflammatory bowel disease, might similar dietary changes help prevent relapses of ulcerative colitis?\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Previously I\'ve talked about the role animal protein may play in the development of inflammatory bowel disease, thought to be because of the putrefying animal protein gas. But what if you already have ulcerative colitis? Can cutting down on sulfur- containing amino acids help? Before this study was published, the only thing shown really to help was the withdrawal of milk. Case reports going back decades described patients with ulcerative colitis whose flares appeared to be triggered by cow\'s milk, and the elimination of all dairy products from the diet was reported to frequently result in a dramatic improvements in symptoms. But when milk was reintroduced back into their diets, it could trigger an attack. It wasn\'t formally studied, though, until 1965. Was it just a small group of patients who were maybe allergic or something, or could a milk-free diet help with the disease in general? So they randomized patients presenting with an attack of ulcerative colitis into a milk-free diet, or a control placebo ""dummy"" diet where they told people just not to eat a bunch of random things to make it seem like they were getting special treatment. The milk-free diet worked better: twice as many were symptom free off of all dairy, and fewer patients  suffered relapses. So there seems to be a certain proportion of ulcerative colitis patients that would benefit from eliminating all dairy. They estimate that milk is a trigger in about one in every five, so certainly sufferers should try a dairy-free diet trial to see if they\'re one of the lucky ones that can be controlled with such a simple dietary intervention. OK, but what about cutting back on sulfur-containing amino acids in general? This study of four ulcerative colitis sufferers found that their daily bouts of bloody diarrhea significantly lessened. So reduced intake of sulfur-containing amino acids, or sulfur-containing amino acid rich foods, produced an improvement in moderately severe ulcerative colitis. What happened when they added these foods back? The researchers felt the effect was so dramatic that challenging back with foods like meat, dairy, eggs, and sulfited wine was considered unethical. This was just a pilot study, though. Researchers then set up a study in which 191 ulcerative colitis patients, in remission, were followed for a year along with their diets, to determine which foods were associated with a relapse, and it turned out to be meat and alcohol. This makes sense because they\'re both rich sources of sulfur, which may increase the concentration of hydrogen sulfide, which, if you remember, is toxic because it interferes with our body\'s utilization of fiber, which our good bacteria turn into this beneficial compound called butyrate. So, how can we increase fecal butyrate levels to counteract any hydrogen sulfide? Well, butyrate enemas have been shown to be of benefit, but if it\'s formed from fiber, can\'t we just get it coming in the regular way? Yes. Ulcerative colitis sufferers were given oat bran for three months, making their good bacteria happy. None of them relapsed, and their symptoms appeared to be under better control. One of the common questions we physicians treating patients with IBD, inflammatory bowel disease, are often asked is whether changing diet could positively affect the course of their disease? So far our answer, especially for ulcerative colitis, has been, ""We don\'t know; no special recommendations."" This may now change, though, with this study that suggests that the consumption of meat may aggravate the course of inflammatory bowel disease. So folks may want to cut down on meat, meaning like no more than once a week. We don\'t have confirmation from interventional studies to support the specifics, but that could be considered like the best available evidence we have right now.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Today, on the Nutrition Facts Podcast, we discover why well-balanced gastrointestinal tract is key to our health and well-being.

Well, the amazing thing is, with the right diet, you\'re well on your way to achieving these vital health goals. Welcome to the Nutrition Facts Podcast. I\'m your host, Dr. Michael Greger. Today it’s all about the gut, otherwise known as the gastrointestinal tract. And we’ll start with a study that looks at the microbiome of those eating plant based diets. Almost 2,500 years ago, Hippocrates stated that “All disease begins in the gut.” Feed our gut bacteria right, with whole plant-foods, and they feed us right back with beneficial compounds like butyrate, which gut bugs make from fiber. Feed them wrong, on the other hand, and they can produce detrimental compounds like TMAO, which our gut bugs make from cheese, seafood, eggs, and meat. Now we used to think that TMAO only contributed to cardiovascular diseases, like heart disease and stroke, but more recently it has been linked to everything from psoriatic arthritis to polycystic ovary syndrome. I’m most concerned about our leading killers, though. If you look at the top ten causes of death in the United States, we know about heart disease and stroke, killers #1 and #5, but recently, an association has been between blood levels of TMAO and the risks of various cancers, killer #2. It could be the inflammation caused by TMAO that explains the link between TMAO and cancer, but it could also be oxidative stress such as free radicals, DNA damage, or a disruption in protein folding. Killer #4 are chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases like emphysema, and TMAO is associated with premature death in patients with exacerbated COPD, though they suspect it’s just due to them dying from more cardiovascular disease. The link to stroke is a no-brainer—no pun intended— because of the higher blood pressure associated with higher TMAO levels as well as the greater likelihood of clot formation in those with atrial fibrillation. And those with higher TMAO levels also appear to have worse strokes and four times the odds of death. Killer #6 is Alzheimer’s disease. Does TMAO even get up into the brain? Yes, TMAO is present in human cerebrospinal fluid, which bathes the brain, and indeed the levels are higher in both those with mild cognitive dysfunction and those with Alzheimer’s disease dementia. In the brain, TMAO has been shown to induce neuronal senescence (meaning deterioration with age), increased oxidative stress and impaired mitochondrial function, all of which may contribute to brain aging and cognitive impairment. Killer #7 is diabetes, and people with higher TMAO levels are approximately 50% more likely to have diabetes too. Killer #8 is pneumonia, and TMAO predicts fatal outcomes in pneumonia patients even without evident heart disease. Killer #9 is kidney disease, and TMAO is strongly related to kidney function and predicts fatal outcomes there as well. Over a period of five years, more than a half of chronic kidney disease patients who started out with an average or higher TMAO levels were dead, whereas among those in the lowest third of levels, nearly 90% remain alive. Okay, so how can we lower the TMAO levels in our blood? Because TMAO originates from dietary sources, we could limit our intake of choline and carnitine-rich foods, but they’re ""so widespread"", we’re talkin’ meat, eggs, and dairy. Therefore, restriction of foods rich in TMAO-creating nutrients may not be practical. I mean, can’t we just get a vegan fecal transplant? Vegan donors were kind enough to provide the investigators with a fresh morning sample. If you remember, if you give a vegan a steak, despite all the carnitine in the meat, they make almost no TMAO compared to a meat-eater, presumably because they haven’t been fostering steak-eating bugs in their gut. Remarkably, even if you give plant-based eaters the equivalent of a 20-ounce steak every day for two months, only about half start ramping up production of TMAO showing just how far their gut flora had to change. The capacity of veggie feces to churn out TMAO is almost nonexistent. So, instead of eating healthier, why not just get some of that sweet vegan poop off the brown market. In a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial, research subjects either got vegan poop or their own poop back. The complete stool production was stirred—not shaken— and then infused through a hose down their nose, and . . . it didn’t work. First of all, the vegans they recruited for their study started out making TMAO themselves, as opposed to the other study where they didn’t make any at all. This may be because the other study required the vegans to have been plant-based for at least a year, and this study didn’t. So yeah, not much of a change in TMAO running through their bodies two weeks after getting the vegan poop, but the vegan poop they got seemed to start out with some capacity to produce TMAO in the first place. So, the failure to improve after the vegan fecal transplant could be related to limited baseline microbiome differences as well as the continuation of an omnivorous diet after the transplant. What’s the point of trying to reset your microbiome if you’re just going to eat meat? Well, the researchers didn’t want to switch people to a plant-based diet since they knew that alone can change your microbiome, and they didn’t want to introduce any extra factors. Bottom line—no pun intended— it looks like there may not be any shortcuts. We may just have to eat a healthier diet. Did you know that more than half of IBS sufferers (irritable bowel syndrome) appear to have a form of atypical food allergy? Here’s the story. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic gastrointestinal disorder that affects about one in ten. You may have heard about those low-FODMAP diets, but they don\'t appear to work any better than the standard advice to avoid things like coffee or spicy and fatty foods; in fact, you can hardly tell which is which. But most IBS patients do seem to react to specific foods, such as wheat, dairy, soy sauce, or eggs, though when you test them for typical food allergies, they may come up negative on a skin prick test. But what you want to know is not what happens on their skin but inside their gut when you eat them. Enter confocal laser endomicroscopy. How cool is this? You can snake a microscope down someone\'s throat into their gut and drip on some foods and watch in real-time as the gut wall becomes inflamed and leaky. You can actually see the cracks forming within minutes. But it had never been tested on a largeÂ\xa0group of IBS patients until now. Using this new technology, researchers found that more than half of IBS sufferers have this kind of reaction to various foods, what they call an atypical food allergy, that flies under the radar of traditional allergy tests. Exclude those foods from the diet, and you get a significant alleviation of symptoms. But outside of a research setting, there\'s no way to know which foods are the culprit without trying your own exclusion diet. And there\'s no greater exclusion diet than excluding everything. A 25-year-old woman had complained of abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea for a year, and drugs didn\'t seem to help. But after fasting for 10 days, her symptoms improved considerably and appeared to stay that way at least 18 months later. And it wasn\'t just subjective improvement. They took biopsies that showed the inflammation go down, directly measured her bowel irritability, and stuck expanding balloons and electrodes in her rectum to actually measure changes in her sensitivity to pressure and electrical stimulation. Fasting seemed to kind of reboot her gut, but just because it worked for her doesn\'t mean it works for others. Case reports are most useful when they inspire researchers to put it to the test. Despite research efforts, medical treatment for this condition is still unsatisfactory. We can try to suppress the symptoms with drugs, but what do you do when even that doesn\'t work? Eighty-four IBS patients, 58 of whom who failed basic treatment which consisted of pharmacotherapy and brief psychotherapy, 36 of the 58 who were still suffering underwent 10 days of fasting, whereas the other 22 stuck with the basic treatment. And those in the fasting group experienced significant improvements in abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite, nausea, anxiety, and interference with life in general, which was significantly better than the control group. The researchers concluded that fasting therapy could be useful for treating moderate to severe patients with IBS. Unfortunately, patient allocation was neither blinded nor randomized, so the comparison to the control group doesn\'t mean much. They were also given IV vitamins--- B1 and vitamin C--- which seems typical of these Japanese fasting trials, even though one wouldn\'t expect to get vitamin deficiency syndromes--- beriberi or scurvy---to present within just 10 days of fasting. And they were also kept isolated, and maybe that made the psychotherapy work better? It\'s hard to tease out just the fasting effects. Psychotherapy alone can provide lasting benefits. One hundred and one outpatients with irritable bowel syndrome were randomized to medical treatment or medical treatment with three months of psychotherapy. After three months, the psychotherapy group did better, and the difference was even more pronounced a year later--- a year after the psychotherapy ended. Better at 3 months and even better at 15 months. Psychological approaches appear to work about as well as antidepressant drugs for IBS, but the placebo response for IBS is on the order of 40%, and that\'s whether we\'re talking about psychological interventions or drugs or alternative medicine approaches. So essentially nothing---a sugar pill--- improves symptoms 40% of the time. So I figure one might as well choose a therapy first that\'s cheap, safe, simple, and side effect free,')]","To improve digestion and reduce bloating after eating heavy meals, Alessio can consider making the following dietary adjustments based on Dr. Michael Greger's insights:

1. **Reduce Fat Intake**: High-fat meals can slow down the stomach's emptying rate, which may increase feelings of fullness and bloating. Alessio should consider reducing the amount of fat in his meals, especially from sources like fatty meats, high-fat dairy products, and deep-fried foods.

2. **Increase Fiber Intake**: Including more fiber-rich foods such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes can help improve digestion and prevent bloating. Fiber helps regulate the digestive system and can promote a more consistent bowel movement.

3. **Avoid Dairy if Sensitive**: Some individuals are sensitive to dairy products, which can cause bloating and discomfort. If Alessio notices that dairy products worsen his symptoms, he might benefit from reducing or eliminating them from his diet.

4. **Eat Smaller, More Frequent Meals**: Instead of consuming large, heavy meals, Alessio could try eating smaller portions more frequently throughout the day. This can help prevent overwhelming the digestive system and reduce bloating.

5. **Stay Hydrated**: Drinking adequate fluids, especially water, can help support digestion and reduce bloating. It's important to stay hydrated, particularly when increasing fiber intake.

6. **Mindful Eating**: Eating slowly and chewing food thoroughly can improve digestion and reduce bloating. It's also beneficial to eat in a relaxed environment to support digestive health.

By implementing these dietary adjustments, Alessio can help improve his digestion and reduce bloating after eating heavy meals. If symptoms persist, it may be helpful to consult with a healthcare provider or a dietitian for further evaluation and personalized advice.","To improve digestion and reduce bloating after eating heavy meals, Alessio can consider making the following dietary adjustments based on Dr. Michael Greger's insights:

Learning about fruit, vegetables, and cancer prevention was a hallmark. But hitting the top 5, cited more than 2,000 times, “Dietary modulation of the human microbiom introducing the concept of prebiotics.” Prebiotics are the food components that feed and nourish the good bacteria in our gut, like fiber and resistant starch. In general, eating high-fiber plant foods is a good foundation for a prebiotic-rich diet. Once upon a time, fiber was just thought of as just the undigested component of foods, known only for bulking up stools and keeping our bowels regular. Then, we discovered an array of receptors in the body in which fiber breakdown products fit in like a lock-and-key. We feed our good bacteria with fiber, and they feed us right back, munching the fiber and creating short chain fatty acids that get absorbed into our bloodstream and fit into these receptors that are expressed on immune cells and generally mediate a direct anti-inﬂammatory effect. So, the reason for lower systemic inﬂammation in plant-based eaters may not just be due to the abundance of anti-inﬂammatory molecules in plant foods or the avoidance of proinﬂammatory molecules in animal foods, but from the production of anti-inflammatory molecules from scratch by our good gut bugs when we feed them fiber. Just to give you an idea how protective fiber-rich foods can be, those randomized to get advice to eat fiber-rich plant foods during radiation therapy for cancer didn’t just experience reduced toxicity during the treatments, but even a full year later. Indeed, the benefits of fiber are supported by more than a century of research. Prospective studies show striking reductions in death from all causes put together, including “total cancer deaths, total cardiovascular disease deaths and incidence, stroke incidence, and incidence of colorectal, breast, and esophageal cancer.” And “dose-response relationships” suggest that the more the better, in terms of protecting against heart attacks and stroke, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. So, at a minimum, fiber intakes should be no less than 25–29 grams per day,with additional benefits likely to accrue with higher intakes. Yet, the average American only consumes about 16 grams of ﬁber per day. We have coevolved over millennia with gut bacteria to the point of reliance on our good gut bugs, a kind of symbiosis for ﬁber digestion and the production of short chain fatty acids, and even certain vitamins. Yet, we’re not holding up our end of the bargain. We’re supposed to be providing up to 100 or so grams of fiber a day, and we are barely passing along a measly 16 grams. The simplest solution, the simplest approach to remedy this lack of dietary fiber is to encourage consumption of whole food plant-based nutrition.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'In certain medical conditions, probiotic supplements may actually make things worse.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

This suggests raw fruits and vegetables may not only be a source of prebiotics—fiber— but also a source of novel probiotics. Researchers have since worked on characterizing these bacterial communities and found two interesting things. First, that the communities on each produce type were significantly distinct from one another. So, the tree fruits harbor different bacteria than veggies on the ground, and grapes and mushrooms seem to be off in their own little world. So, if indeed these bugs turn out to be good for us, that would underscore the importance of eating not just a greater quantity, but greater variety of fruits and veggies every day. And second, they found that there were significant differences in microbial community composition between conventional and organic produce. This highlights the potential for differences in the bacteria between conventionally and organically farmed produce items to  impact human health; but, we don’t know in what direction. They certainly found different bacteria on organic versus conventional, but we don’t know enough about fruit and veggie bugs to make a  determination as to which bacterial communities are healthier. What about probiotic supplements? I’ve talked about the potential benefits, but there appears to be publication bias in the scientific literature about probiotics. This is something you see a lot with drug companies, where the sponsor, the supplement company paying for their own probiotic research, may not report negative results, not publish it, as if the study ever happened. And so, then, we doctors just see the positive studies. Using fancy statistical techniques, they estimated that as many as 20 unflattering studies were simply MIA. And, even in the studies that were published, even when the authors were directly sponsored by like some yogurt company, the conflicts of interest were very commonly not reported. There’s also been concerns about safety. A review for the government’s Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concluded that there’s a lack of assessment and systematic reporting of adverse events in probiotic intervention studies; so, while the available evidence in randomized controlled trials does not indicate an increased risk for the general public, the current literature is not well equipped to answer questions on the safety of probiotics with confidence. This is the study that freaked people out a bit. Acute pancreatitis, sudden inflammation of the pancreas, is on the rise, which can become life threatening in some cases, as bacteria break through our gut barrier and infect our internal organs. Antibiotics don’t seem to work, so how about probiotics? Seemed to work on rats. If you cause inflammation by cutting them open and mechanically damaging their pancreas, not only do probiotics show strong evidence for efficacy, but there were no indications of harmful effects— So, half the people with pancreatitis got probiotics, half got sugar pills, and, within 10 days, the mortality rates shot up in the probiotics group compared to placebo. More than twice as many people died on the probiotics. Thus, probiotics for acute pancreatitis probably is not a good idea. But, further, probiotics can no longer be considered to be just completely harmless. The researchers were criticized for not telling patients, not cautioning patients about the risk before signing up for the study. (The study subjects were told probiotics had a long history of safe use with no known side effects). In response to the criticism, the researchers replied there were no known side effects—until their study.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Food for gut health: Our gut flora is determined by what we eat, for good or for ill.\n\nI have a lot of videos on our microbiome and gut health.

And if you want more, just go to NutritionFacts.Org/Topics/Microbiome for all my videos on good gut health. ""How to Cultivate a Healthy Gut Microbiome with Food"" When we eat meat, dairy, eggs, seafood, our gut flora can take certain components in them (carnitine and choline) and produce something that ends up as a toxic compound called TMAO, which may set us up for a heart attack, stroke, and death. So, give people two eggs, and you get a spike of TMAO in your bloodstream within hours of consumption. Because gut bacteria play a critical role in this process, though, if you then give them a week of antibiotics to wipe out their gut flora and refeed them two more eggs, nothing happens. No TMAO in their bloodstream because they have no egg-eating bacteria to make it. But give it a month for their gut bacteria to start to grow back, and the eggs start to cause TMAO production once again. The same thing with meat. Give people the equivalent of an 11-ounce steak, and TMAO levels shoot up in the blood. But feed them the same amount after a week of antibiotics and nothing happens. So to run into problems, you need both the meat and the meat-eating bugs. That\'s why you can feed a vegan a sirloin, and they don\'t produce TMAO within their body. They just don\'t have the meat-eating bugs in their gut. Okay, now this should all be old news for those who\'ve been following the science. The reason for this video is to show that this phenomenon happens the other way around, too. When we eat whole plant foods, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans, along with nuts and seeds, our gut flora can take certain components in them (fiber and resistant starch) and produce short-chain fatty acids which can set us up for the prevention of human diseases. Short-chain fatty acids like butyrate can help seal up a leaky gut, fight inflammation, prevent weight gain, improve insulin sensitivity, accelerate weight loss, and fight cancer. But these benefits rely on two things: eating fiber and having fiber-feeding bugs, just like the detrimental effects from TMAO required not only eggs, dairy, or meat, but also the eggs, dairy, or meat-munching bugs. Check this out. If you give people whole intact grains — in this case barley kernels, also known as barley groats — three servings a day, like I recommend in my Daily Dozen app, within just three days of eating that extra 30+ grams of fiber and resistant starch, their gut bugs were so happy and produced so many short-chain fatty acids that people\'s insulin levels improved by 25%, which means their bodies needed to produce less insulin to take care of the same amount of white bread, while still dampening the blood sugar spike. But this was on average. Some people responded to all that extra fiber with beautiful dips in blood sugar and insulin responses, but in others, the same amount of fiber and resistant starch didn\'t work at all. Why? Because you don\'t just need fiber, but fiber-feeding bugs like Prevotella. How do you get more Prevotella so you can take full advantage of the health benefits of plants? Eat more plants. Prevotella abundance is associated with long-term fiber intake. If you look at rural African children eating 97% whole food, plant-based diets, their Prevotella is off the charts compared to kids eating standard Western diets, and this is reflected in the amount of short-chain fatty acids they are churning out in their poop. In the industrialized world, it\'s those habitually eating vegetarian and vegan that promotes the enrichment of fiber-eating bacteria in the gut. Here\'s the relative Prevotella abundance between those who eat meat, no meat, or all plants. This may help explain the worse inflammatory profile in omnivores than in vegetarians. Based on the findings relative to bacteria abundance, the researchers suggest that exposure to animal foods may favor an intestinal environment which could trigger systemic inflammation and insulin resistance-dependent metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. And it\'s the reduced levels of inflammation that may be the key factor linking a plant-based gut microbiota with protective health benefits. Yeah, but can\'t meat-eaters eat lots of plants, too? Omnivores have constraints on diet-dependent gut microbiome metabolite production. In other words, it\'s the flip side of the vegan eating a steak. They can eat all the fiber they want but may be lacking in fiber-munching machinery. At low levels of fiber intake, the more you eat, the more of the beneficial short-chain fatty acids are made. But at a certain point, your available fiber-feeders are maxed out, and there\'s only so much you can benefit. But those habitually eating a plant-based diet have been cultivating the growth of these fiber-feeders, and the sky\'s the limit, unless, of course, you\'re eating vegan junk. But a whole food, plant-based diet should be effective in promoting a diverse ecosystem of beneficial bacteria to support both our gut microbiome and our overall health.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Sulfur dioxide preservatives in dried fruit, sulfites in wine, and the putrefaction of undigested animal protein in the colon can release hydrogen sulfide, the rotten egg gas associated with inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

I saw this on a shirt once with some friends and I was such the party pooper -- no pun intended -- explaining to everyone how meat is fully digested in the small intestine, and never makes it down into the colon. No fun hanging out with biology geeks --- but I was wrong! It\'s been estimated that with a typical Western diet, up to 12 grams of protein per day can escape digestion, and when it reaches the colon it can be turned into toxic substances like ammonia. This degradation of undigested protein in the colon is called putrefaction, so a little meat can actually end up putrefying in our colon. The problem is that some of the by-products of this putrefaction can be toxic. It\'s generally accepted that carbohydrate fermentation - the fiber and resistant starches that reach our colon - results in beneficial effects for the host because of the generation of short chain fatty acids like butyrate, whereas protein fermentation is considered detrimental for us. Protein fermentation mainly occurs in the lower end of colon, when carbohydrates get depleted and results in the production of potentially toxic metabolites. Perhaps that\'s why we see more colorectal cancer and ulcerative colitis lower down, because that\'s where the protein is putrefying. The most simple strategy to reduce the degree of potentially harmful compounds by protein fermentation is probably a reduction in dietary protein intake. But the accumulation of these harmful by-products of protein metabolism may be attenuated by the fermentation of undigested plant matter. This study showed that if you give people foods containing resistant starch -- that means starch resistant to small intestine digestion so it can feed our good bacteria down in our colon; foods such as cooked beans, peas, lentils, raw oatmeal, cold pasta -- you can block the accumulation  of these potentially harmful byproducts of protein metabolism. The more starch ending up in the stool, the less ammonia, for example. But there\'s protein in plants, too. The difference is that animal proteins tend to have more sulfur-containing amino acids like methionine that can be turned into hydrogen sulfide in our colon, the rotten egg gas that may play a role in the development of the inflammatory bowel diseases like ulcerative colitis as I\'ve covered previously. The toxic effects of hydrogen sulfide appear to be mediated through blocking the ability of our colon cells to utilize butyrate, which is what our good bacteria make from the fiber we eat. So it\'s like this constant battle in our colon between the bad metabolites of protein, hydrogen sulfide, and the good metabolites of carbohydrates, butyrate. Using human colon samples they were able to show that the adverse effects of sulfide could be reversed by butyrate. So we can either cut down on meat, eat more plants, or both. But there\'s two ways hydrogen sulfide can be produced. Though it\'s mainly present in our large intestine as a result of the breakdown of these sulfur-containing proteins, rotten egg gas can also be generated from inorganic sulfur preservatives like sulfites and sulfur dioxide. Sulfur dioxide is used as a preservative in dried fruit, and sulfites are added to wine. We can avoid sulfur additives by reading labels or by just choosing organic, since by law they\'re forbidden from organic fruits and beverages. Now cabbage family vegetables naturally have some sulfur compounds, but thankfully, after following more than a 100,000 women for over 25 years, cruciferous vegetables were NOT associated with elevated colitis risk. But because of the animal protein and preservative laden processed foods, the standard American diet may have five or six times more sulfur than a diet centered around unprocessed plant foods, which may help explain the rarity of inflammatory bowel disease among those eating traditional whole food plant-based diets.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Resistant starch is found naturally in many common foods, including beans, whole grains, and vegetables.

Typical Western diets can decimate our good gut flora. We live with trillions of symbionts, good bacteria that live in symbiosis with us. We help them, they help us, and a month on a plant-based diet results in an increase of the good guys, and a decrease in the bad, the so-called pathobionts, the disease-causing bugs. “Given the disappearance of pathobionts from the intestine, one would expect to observe a  reduction in intestinal inflammation.” So, they measured stool concentrations of lipocalin-2, which is a sensitive biomarker of intestinal inflammation, and within a month of eating healthy, it had declined significantly, suggesting that promotion of microbial homeostasis, or balance, by a strict vegetarian diet resulted in reduced intestinal inflammation, and this rebalancing may have played a role in improved metabolic and immune system parameters. On an animal-based diet, you get growth of disease-associated species like bilophila wadsworthia, associated with inflammatory bowel disease, and A. putredinis, found in abscesses and appendicitis, and a decrease in fiber-eating bacteria. Eat fiber, and the fiber munching bacteria multiply, and we get more anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer short-chain fatty acids. Eat less fiber, and our fiber- eating bacteria starve away They are what we eat. Eat a lot of phytates, and your gut flora get really good at breaking down phytates. We assumed that this was just because we were naturally selecting for those populations of bacteria that could do that, but it turns out our diet can teach old bugs new tricks. There’s one type of fiber in nori seaweed that our gut bacteria can’t normally breakdown, but the bacteria out in the ocean that eat seaweed have the enzyme to do so. When it was discovered that the enzyme was present in the guts of Japanese people, it presented a mystery. Sure, sushi is eaten raw; and so, some seaweed bacteria may have made it into their colons, but how could some marine bacteria thrive in the human gut? It didn’t need to; it transferred the nori-eating enzyme to our own gut bacteria. “Consequently, the consumption of food with associated environmental bacteria is the most likely mechanism that [promoted the enzyme update into our own gut microbes],” almost like a software update. We have the same hardware, the same gut bacteria, but they just updated their software to chew on something new. Hardware can change too, though. The reason this  is called, “The way to a man’s heart is through his gut and microbiota” is because they were talking about TMAO. Certain gut flora can take carnitine from the red meat we eat, or the choline concentrated in dairy, seafood, and eggs and convert it into a toxic compound which may lead to an increase in our risk of heart attack, stroke, and death. This explains why those eating more plant based diets have lower blood concentrations of the stuff, but they also produce less of the toxin even if you feed them a steak. You don’t see the same conversion, suggesting an adaptive response of the gut microbiota in omnivores. They are what we feed them. It’s like if you give people cyclamate, a synthetic artificial sweetener, most of our bacteria don’t know what to do with it. But if you feed it to people for 10 days and select for the few bacteria that were hip to the new synthetic chemical, eventually three quarters of the cyclamate you eat is metabolized by the bacteria into another new compound called cyclohexylamine. But stop eating it and those bacteria die back. Unfortunately, cyclohexylamine may be toxic and so, was banned by the FDA in 1969, whereas, regular Kool-Aid, evidently, is completely safe. But, if you just ate cyclamate once in a while, it wouldn’t turn into cyclohexamine, because you wouldn’t have fed and fostered the gut flora specialized to do so, and the same with TMAO. Those that just eat red meat, or eggs, or seafood once in a while would presumably make very little of the toxin because they hadn’t been cultivating the bacteria that produce it.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Subscribe for free to Dr. Greger's videos at:\nhttp://nutritionfacts.org/subscribe/\n\nDESCRIPTION: Though prebiotics may be preferable, probiotics may reduce the risk of upper respiratory tract infections.\n\nHave a question for Dr. Greger about this video?

Babies delivered via caesarean section appear to be   at increased risk for various allergic diseases. The thought is that vaginal delivery leads to the first   colonization of the gut with maternal vaginal bacteria, while C-section babies are deprived of this  natural exposure, and exhibit a different gut flora. This is supported by research noting that  disturbance in maternal vaginal flora during pregnancy may be associated with early asthma in their children. This all suggests our natural gut flora can affect the development  of our immune system for better or for worse. In adulthood, two studies published back in 2001 suggested   that probiotics could have systemic immunity enhancing effects. Subjects were given a probiotic regimen between weeks 3 to 6 and saw a significant boost in the ability of their white blood cells to chomp down on potential invaders. And what\'s interesting is that even after the probiotics were stopped  there was still enhanced immune function a few weeks later compared to baseline. The same boost was found in the ability of  their natural killer cells to kill cancer cells. And similar results were also found using a different probiotic strain. Improving immune cell function in a petri dish is nice, but   does this actually translate into people having fewer infections? For that, we had to wait another 10 years, but now we have randomized double-blind placebo-controlled studies showing that  those taking probiotics may have significantly  fewer colds, fewer sick days, and fewer symptoms. The latest review of the best studies to date found that   probiotics, such as those in yogurt, soy yogurt, or supplements, may indeed reduce one\'s risk of upper respiratory tract infection, but the totality of evidence is still considered weak,  so it\'s probably too early to make a blanket recommendation. Unless one has suffered a major disruption of  gut flora by antibiotics or an intestinal infection, unless one is symptomatic with like diarrhea or bloating, I would suggest focusing on feeding the good bacteria we   already have, by eating so-called prebiotics such as fiber. After all, as we saw before, who knows what you\'re getting when you buy probiotics, they may not even be alive by the time you buy them. They also have to survive the journey down to the large intestine. Altogether, these points suggest that the advantages of prebiotics –   found in plant foods – outweigh those of probiotics. And by eating raw fruits and vegetables, we may be getting both. Fruits and vegetables are covered with millions of lactic acid bacteria,   some of which are the same type used as probiotics.

In other words, primarily fiber. One reason we can get an increase of nearly two grams of stool for every one gram of fiber is that the fiber fermentation process in our colon promotes bacterial growth. The bulk of our stool by weight is pure bacteria, trillions and trillions of bacteria, and that was on a whimpy, fiber-deficient British diet. People who take fiber supplements know this— a few spoonfuls of fiber can lead to a massive bowel movement, because fiber is what our good gut bacteria thrive on. When we eat a whole plant food like fruit, we’re telling our gut flora to be fruitful, and multiply. And from fiber, our gut flora produce short-chain fatty acids, which are an important energy source for the cells lining our colon. So, we feed our flora with fiber, and then they turn around and feed us right back. These short chain fatty acids also function to suppress inflammation and cancer. That’s why eating fiber may be so good for us. But when we don’t eat enough whole plant foods, we are in effect starving our microbial self. On traditional plant-based diets, like Dr. Burkitt described: lots of fiber, lots of short chain fatty acids, and lots of protection from Western diseases like colon cancer. Whereas on a standard American diet, where we’re eating highly processed food, there’s nothing left over for our gut flora. It\'s all absorbed in  the small intestine before it ever makes it down to the colon. Not only may this mean loss of beneficial microbial metabolites, but also a loss in beneficial microbes themselves. The biggest issue presented by a Western diet is that not leaving anything for our bacteria to eat results in dysbiosis, an imbalance where bad bacteria can take over and increase our susceptibility to inflammatory diseases or colon cancer, or maybe even metabolic syndrome  or type 2 diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. It’s like when astronauts return from space flights having lost most of their good bacteria because they had no access to real food. Well, too many of us are leading an “astronaut-type lifestyle,” not eating fresh fruits and vegetables. For example, the astronauts lost nearly 100% of their Lactobacillus plantarum, which is one of the good guys. But most Americans don’t have any to begin with, though those that eat more plant-based are certainly doing better. Use it or lose it. If you feed people resistant starch, a type of fiber found in beans, within days the bacteria that eat resistant starch shoot up, and then die back off when you stop eating it. Eating just a half can of chickpeas every day may modulate the intestinal microbial composition to promote intestinal health, by increasing potentially good bacteria and decreasing pathogenic and putrefactive bacteria. Unfortunately most Americans don’t eat beans every day, or whole grains, or enough fruits and vegetables, so the gut flora, the gut microbiota of a seemingly healthy person may not be the equivalent to a healthy gut flora. It’s possible that the Western microbiota is actually dysbiotic in the first place, just because we’re eating such fiber-deficient diets compared to populations that may eat five times more fiber and end up with like 50 times less colon cancer.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Inadequate consumption of prebiotics—the fiber and resistant starch concentrated in unprocessed plant foods—can cause a disease promoting imbalance in our gut microbiome.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

These foods undergo a fermentation process that encourages the growth of beneficial bacteria, which are important for maintaining a healthy gut microbiome. Here are some fermented foods to consider:

1. **Sauerkraut**: Made from fermented cabbage, sauerkraut is rich in probiotics and fiber. It’s important to choose raw, unpasteurized sauerkraut to ensure it contains live probiotics.

2. **Kimchi**: A Korean dish similar to sauerkraut but made with a mix of cabbage, radishes, and spices. It’s also rich in probiotics and can add a spicy kick to meals.

3. **Kefir**: A fermented milk drink similar to yogurt but with a thinner consistency. It’s typically made from cow's or goat's milk fermented with kefir grains and is packed with various strains of beneficial bacteria and yeasts.

4. **Tempeh**: Made from fermented soybeans, tempeh is a great source of protein and fiber. It has a firm texture and a nutty flavor, making it a popular meat substitute in vegetarian and vegan diets.

5. **Miso**: A Japanese seasoning produced by fermenting soybeans with salt and a fungus known as koji. Miso is commonly used in soups and sauces and offers a rich, salty flavor.

6. **Yogurt**: Look for yogurts that contain live active cultures, which are beneficial for gut health. Yogurt is also a good source of protein, calcium, and vitamins.

7. **Kombucha**: A fermented tea drink that has become popular for its tangy flavor and purported health benefits, including digestive support due to its probiotic content.

Including these fermented foods in your diet can help enhance your gut microbiome and contribute to overall health. However, if you are new to fermented foods, start with small amounts to see how your body reacts, as they can sometimes cause bloating and gas in sensitive individuals.","To improve gut health naturally through fermented foods, consider including a variety of options that are rich in probiotics.

2. **Kimchi**: A Korean dish similar to sauerkraut but made with a mix of cabbage, radishes, and spices. It’s also rich in probiotics and can add a spicy kick to meals.

3. **Kefir**: A fermented milk drink similar to yogurt but with a thinner consistency. It’s typically made from cow's or goat's milk fermented with kefir grains and is packed with various strains of beneficial bacteria and yeasts.

4. **Tempeh**: Made from fermented soybeans, tempeh is a great source of protein and fiber. It has a firm texture and a nutty flavor, making it a popular meat substitute in vegetarian and vegan diets.

5. **Miso**: A Japanese seasoning produced by fermenting soybeans with salt and a fungus known as koji. Miso is commonly used in soups and sauces and offers a rich, salty flavor.

6. **Yogurt**: Look for yogurts that contain live active cultures, which are beneficial for gut health. Yogurt is also a good source of protein, calcium, and vitamins.

7. **Kombucha**: A fermented tea drink that has become popular for its tangy flavor and purported health benefits, including digestive support due to its probiotic content.

Including these fermented foods in your diet can help enhance your gut microbiome and contribute to overall health. However, if you are new to fermented foods, start with small amounts to see how your body reacts, as they can sometimes cause bloating and gas in sensitive individuals.

Fiber continues to  be singled out as a nutrient of  public health concern. There is a fiber  gap in America. These are the minimum recommended  daily intakes of fiber for men and women at  different age groups; this is how much we’re  actually getting. We’re only getting about  half the minimum, considered a public health  concern for all Americans. Well, not ALL  Americans. Less than 3% meet the  recommended minimum, meaning less than  3% of all Americans eat enough  plant-based foods, the only place  fiber is found, though a nominal 0.1 is thrown in for the meat category in case someone eats a corn dog  or nibbles on the garnish. If even half of the adult population  ate 3 more grams a day, like a quarter cup of beans  or a bowl of oatmeal, we could save billions  in medical costs, and that’s just  for constipation. The consumption  of plant foods, the consumption of  fiber-containing foods reduce risk for diabetes,  heart disease, stroke, cancer, and  obesity as well. The first to make this link between  fiber intake and killer disease was probably Dr. Hugh Trowell  many decades ago. He spent 30 years  practicing in Africa and suspected it was their high  consumption of corn, millet, sweet potatoes,  greens, and beans that protected them  from chronic disease. This kind of got twisted into  the so-called fiber hypothesis, but he didn’t think it  was the fiber itself, but the high-fiber foods  that were so protective. There are hundreds of different  things in whole grains besides fiber that may  have beneficial effects. For example, yes the fiber  in oatmeal can lower our blood cholesterol levels so  less gets stuck in our arteries, but there are anti-inflammatory,  and antioxidant phytonutrients in oats that can help prevent  atherosclerotic build-up and then help maintain  arterial function. Visionaries like Trowell  were not entrapped by the reductionist “simple-minded”  focus on dietary fiber and insisted that the whole plant  foods should receive the emphasis. Fiber intake was just kind of a  marker for plant food intake. Those with highest fiber intake,  and the lowest cholesterol, were those who ate  exclusively plant-based diets. Risk factors like cholesterol  are one thing, but can these individual foods actually  affect the progression of heart disease? We didn’t know, until this  study was published. Hundreds of older women were subjected  to coronary angiograms, where you can inject dye into  the coronary arteries of the heart to see how wide  open they are. They got an angiogram at  the beginning of the study, and then one a  few years later, all while analyzing  their diets. This is what  they found. The arteries of women  eating less than a serving of whole grains a day  significantly narrowed, whereas the arteries of women  who ate just a single serving or more also  significantly narrowed, but they  narrowed less. These were all women  with heart disease eating the standard  American diet, and so their arteries were  progressively clogging shut— heart disease is the #1 killer  of American women, but there was significantly  LESS clogging in the women eating  more whole grains, significantly less progression  of their atherosclerosis. In fact, almost as much slowing of  their disease as one might get taking cholesterol  lowering statin drugs. Statins can also slow the rate  at which our arteries close. But do we want to just slow the rate  at which we die from heart disease, or NOT die from heart  disease at all? A whole food, plant-based diet has been shown to REVERSE the progression  of heart disease, opening our arteries  back up. Whole grains, like the drug,  can help counter the artery-clogging effects  of the rest of the diet. Having oatmeal with bacon and eggs, is better than just eating  bacon and eggs, but better,perhaps, to stop eating  an artery-clogging diet altogether.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Less than 3% of Americans meet the daily recommended fiber intake, despite research suggesting high-fiber foods such as whole grains can affect the progression of coronary heart disease.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

You hear a lot of that larger-than-life talk about amla coming out of Indian medical journals. Who can forget “Amla, a wonder berry in the treatment and prevention of cancer.” Amla is so revered that you find serious scientists, at serious academic institutions, in serious peer-reviewed medical journals, making statements like this: “Every part of the Indian gooseberry plant has its unique therapeutic characteristic for the remedy of almost all the ailments and can be adopted as a single bullet against disease.” OK, then. I first ran across it in this famous article, looking at the total antioxidant content of thousands of different foods. I did a series of videos about it ages ago. And, to my surprise, the #1 most antioxidant packed single whole food on the planet, on average, was amla: dried powdered Indian gooseberries, beating out the prior heavyweight champion, cloves, with, just for comparison’s sake, up to a hundred times or more antioxidants by weight than blueberries. So, here’s this fruit that has enjoyed “a hallowed position in Ayurveda,” the ancient system of medicine in India - so hallowed it was mythologically pegged as the first tree in the universe. So, for thousands of years—before we even knew what an antioxidant was, they were revering this plant that just so happens to turn out to be the most antioxidant packed fruit on the Planet Earth. OK, you got my attention. But, I still needed to see it put to the test. Well, indigenous tribal healers used amla to treat diabetes. So, researchers decided to give it a try. This is the study that originally bowled me over. In fact, it was the subject of one of my first NutritionFacts videos of all time over 5 years ago: the effect of amla fruit on the blood sugars and cholesterol levels of normal subjects and type 2 diabetic patients. In my video, I talked about the jaw-dropping effects of five cents worth of this powdered fruit, five pennies worth, compared to a diabetes drug. But, what about the cholesterol effects? If you take healthy individuals and give them a placebo sugar pill, nothing much happens to their cholesterol. Ideally, we want our total cholesterol under 150. This was a pretty healthy group, the average cholesterol in the U.S. is over 200, which is where the diabetics started out in this study. And, when you give them placebo pills, nothing much happens either. But, give people just about a half teaspoon of amla powder a day— not some extract or something, just dried Indian gooseberries, a powdered fruit and this is what happens. That’s like a 35-40% drop in three weeks— absolutely astounding. That’s the kind of thing we see like 6 months after putting people on statin drugs. What we care about most is LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol, shooting for under at least 70 ideally. No impact of the placebos, but again, just about a half teaspoon of amla, which would cost you about 5 cents a day, so like a buck fifty a month, and boom. These results knocked my socks off. I mean, they’re just un-believable. That’s why I was so excited after all these years to dig back into the amla literature to see if these findings had been confirmed or replicated elsewhere. So, I typed amla into PubMed and waded through all the papers on using amla to decrease methane in cow farts, and speed the growth of chickens, or hey, what about amla ice cream? After all, amla is packed with fiber and phytonutrients. In contrast, ice cream is not. Therefore… And indeed, amla incorporated into ice cream increases the antioxidant capacity. though I would not recommend it for cholesterol lowering. Ah, but here we go.

Elevated LDL cholesterol levels are also caused, as we have seen, by the lack of consumption of fiber, found in all whole plant foods. Since we evolved to eat enormous quantities of fiber, when we don’t, our LDL ends up much higher than it’s supposed to be. Since all plants have fiber, and all animals have saturated fat and cholesterol, in general, all whole plant foods tend to lower our risk of dying from our #1 killer, and all whole animal foods tend to raise our risk. There are, however, processed plant foods that do raise cholesterol: hydrogenated vegetable oil, for example— and processed animal foods that don’t: skim milk and egg whites. In animal models, animal proteins alone increase cholesterol, but in people, it’s more the animal fat and cholesterol. Or at least in adults. There was a study of one-to three-year olds that found that swapping in wheat protein for milk protein dramatically lowered cholesterol, and then when they went back to milk protein, it rose back up again. But, as the researchers admit, they couldn’t completely control for the cholesterol. The use of the milk protein casein precludes the preparation of a cholesterol-free diet. Cholesterol and animal products go hand in hand— just as it’s hard to create a plant-based diet without some fiber slipping in, even when they tried to feed kids on white flour instead of whole wheat. Bottom line, to block that first step of heart disease, we need to eat more plants, less animals, because that means more fiber, and less saturated fat and cholesterol.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'What are the effects of oatmeal, walnuts, extra virgin olive oil, and avocados on LDL cholesterol size?\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

So, no wonder cholesterol goes down. So, for example, if you take people eating a standard North American diet, including animal fats — dairy and poultry are the  two greatest contributors of cholesterol-raising saturated fat intake- they may start out with an LDL up around here. Just add avocado to their diet without doing anything else and cholesterol does not go down, but add avocado while reducing saturated fat intake, and cholesterol falls, but no more than just  reducing saturated fat while adding nothing. OK, but what if you eat no meat at all, versus no meat with avocado added? They took people with  sky-high cholesterol up around 300 and switched them to a relatively low-fat vegetarian diet with about 20% of calories from fat versus a vegetarian diet  with added avocado, bringing it up to a more  typical fat content, 30% of calories from fat. This group started out with LDLs through the roof and while cutting out meat  may have helped, cutting out meat and adding avocado seemed to help even more. And, it may help best with  the worst type of LDL. As I’ve touched on before, all LDL cholesterol is bad cholesterol, but large, fluffy LDL may only increase the odds of cardiac events, like heart attacks, 31%, whereas small, dense LDL is even worse. Feed people lots of oatmeal and oat bran, and not only does their LDL  go down overall, but it specifically brings down the worst of the worst. Add walnuts to a low-fat diet, and not only does LDL go down, but the size distribution of the LDL shifts to a little more benign as well. And, if you put people on  a plant-based diet with lots of fiber and nuts, you can get a massive 30% drop in LDL, comparable to a cholesterol- lowering statin drug. And, this includes the small, dense most dangerous LDL. Note, this does not happen with extra-virgin olive oil. So, it’s not just a  monounsaturated fat effect. In the famous PREDIMED study, those randomized to the extra nuts group got a significant drop in the smallest, densest LDL, but those randomized to the extra virgin olive oil group did not. So, there appears to be some special components in nuts that lowers the worst of the worst. Do avocados offer similar benefits? We didn\'t know… until, now. In the first randomized  controlled feeding trial to look at avocados and LDL size, what they did was remove animal fat from people’s diet and replaced it with either carbs, or avocados, or vegetable oils that had a similar fat profile to the avocados. So, the two latter diets were very similar diets, but one had the nutrients unique to the avocados and the other didn\'t. What happened? Well, any time you drop saturated fat, you’re going to bring down LDL, whether you replace animal fat with plant fat, oil in this case, or with carbs. But, what if you replace animal fat with the whole plant food avocado— an even better effect. And, to see why, they broke the LDL down into large versus small. They all brought the dangerous large LDL down, but the avocado had the additional effect of also bringing down the super dangerous small LDL. That’s where that extra drop came from. So, it’s not just a matter of replacing animal fat with plant fat; there are additional benefits to the fiber and phytonutrients of whole plant foods like avocados. Oh, there’s something good in avocados? Well then, let’s just add avocado extracts to the meat. Incorporating avocado extracts into pork patties evidently reduces cholesterol  oxidation products, well documented to be toxic, carcinogenic, and atherosclerotic, but less so, apparently, with some avocado mixed in.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Chicken, fish, and egg powder in processed foods present greater risk from cholesterol oxidation byproducts, but there are things you can do to reduce exposure.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

But that\'s not all. Cholesterol oxidation products are associated with the initiation and progression of multiple major chronic diseases, including heart disease,  diabetes, and kidney failure. And they\'re produced when animal products are heated. All forms of cooking can do it, since you can get maximum cholesterol oxidation at only about 300 degrees Fahrenheit. But is there some type of cooking that\'s worse than others? Well, if you look at foal meat, which is like baby horse meat, higher levels of oxidation in general were found in microwaved meat. And indeed, microwaving chicken or beef appears to produce about twice as much cholesterol oxidation than frying. Whereas if you look at bacon, raw bacon wasn\'t found to have any oxidized cholesterol. It has cholesterol, like all animal products, but it\'s not oxidized until you cook it. Grilling seems to be the safest the first time around, but then when you put it back in the fridge and reheat it later using the same method, they all shoot up. It\'s not just heat, though. Although levels in raw meats are usually low, concentrations tend to increase dramatically after exposure to pro-oxidation agents such as light. What are you supposed to do, crawl inside the pig and eat the bacon from the inside? No. You could wrap the meat in red plastic wrap. Clear plastic wrap doesn\'t seem to work, but the red blocks some of the light waves and can delay cholesterol oxidation. This was for horse meat slices. The problem is worse with sliced meat products because more of the meat is exposed to air and light. Same problem with ground meat; it\'s just so much more exposed. Unless you keep meat in some kind of vacuum pack, even in a dark refrigerator the oxygen exposure alone can shoot up oxidation levels. Or in the freezer. Yeah, cooking raw fish can boost levels from 8 to 18, but after a few months frozen fish—even raw— starts out about ten times higher and just goes up from there. And in terms of which meat is the worst, microwaved or fried, chicken was twice as bad as beef. The reason, it seems, has to do with the polyunsaturated fat content of the muscle, which goes fish, then poultry, then pork, then beef, then lamb. So white meat is more susceptible to cholesterol oxidation. Yes, red meat has more saturated fat, but fish and chicken tend to build up more oxidized cholesterol. So, chicken and roasted salmon have been shown to generate greater amounts of cholesterol oxidation products than other types of meat. Surprisingly though, the highest increase of oxidized cholesterol in salmon was found through steaming, mainly just because it\'s exposed to heat longer. Cholesterol oxidation increased after each cooking procedure, but steaming increased the total amount by more than 1000%. There are two ways chicken meat may pull ahead, though. One is if you feed the chickens rancid fat in the first place. And unfortunately, all sorts of substandard stuff ends up at the rendering plant to be turned into animal feed. And also irradiation. When chicken meat is irradiated to improve food safety from an infectious disease standpoint, it may diminish food safety from a chronic disease standpoint. But, hey, it\'s better than dying from salmonella. In terms of dairy, in my last video I talked about the potential dangers of ghee, which made me wonder about UHT milk, which stands for ultra-high temperature processing, to make those little half-and-half no-refrigeration-needed coffee creamers. That does seem to boost oxidized cholesterol levels by about 50%, worse than just regular pasteurization, though interestingly if you can find goat milk half-and-half, that would be safer. Same problem with eggs. Egg powder in processed foods is good for shelf life but may not be so good for human life. So that\'s like packaged food with eggs in it, like pasta, many baked goods, mayonnaise. So even people who stay away from egg eggs may still be unwittingly exposed through processed foods if they don\'t read the label. If it\'s all about oxidation, why not just add synthetic or natural antioxidants to the animal products themselves? They\'ve certainly tried, like what about adding lemon balm tea to hamburger patties? It didn\'t work, but that\'s likely because they couldn\'t add enough without affecting the taste. What about adding cherries? They\'re red, would blend right in. And it worked! Two different types of tart cherries significantly reduced the cholesterol oxidation, but meat with a cherry on top seems a little out of place. How about just good old garlic and onions? Here\'s the amount of oxidized cholesterol in a plain pork chop, significantly reduced by adding onion and garlic, though interestingly in chicken cholesterol oxidation was helped by sage, but not garlic. In fact, garlic may even accelerate fat oxidation. So, there are several measures that can be taken to reduce cholesterol oxidation in foods: reducing the total cholesterol content in food by not cooking food with cholesterol-containing fat like butter or lard; maybe we can feed animals antioxidants before or add them afterwards; use as-low-a-temperature to cook as possible; use some kind of opaque vacuum packing or something. But if you take a step back, only foods that start out with cholesterol can end up with oxidized cholesterol. So, the primary method, in terms of reducing cholesterol oxidation in foods, may be to reduce the total cholesterol content of the food, not just by avoiding adding extra with butter, but instead centering one\'s diet around whole plant foods, which don\'t have any cholesterol to get oxidized in the first place.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'The remarkable impact of the structure of food beyond nutritional content or composition.\n\nIn case you missed my previous cereal video, check out The Worst Food for Tooth Decay (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/the-worst-food-for-tooth-decay).

And the physical form of food not only alters fat absorption, but carbohydrate absorption as well. For example, rolled oats have a significantly lower glycemic index than instant oatmeal, which is just oats but in thinner flakes. And oat flakes cause lower blood sugar and insulin spikes than powdered oats. Same single ingredient, oats, but in different forms can have different effects. Why do we care? Well, the overly rapid absorption of carbohydrates after eating a high-glycemic index meal can trigger “a sequence of hormonal and metabolic changes” that may promote excessive eating. They took a dozen obese teen boys and fed them different meals, each with the same number of calories, and just followed them for the next five hours to measure their subsequent food intake. And those that got the instant oatmeal went on to eat 53 percent more than after eating the same number of calories of steel-cut oatmeal. The instant oatmeal group was snacking within an hour after the meal and goes on to accumulate significantly more calories throughout the rest of the day. Same food, but different form, different effect. Instant oatmeal isn’t as bad as some breakfast cereals, though, which can get up into the 80s or 90s, even a cereal with zero sugar like shredded wheat. The new industrial methods used to create breakfast cereals such as extrusion cooking and explosive puffing accelerate starch digestion and absorption, causing an exaggerated blood sugar response, added sugar or not. Shredded wheat has the same ingredients as spaghetti— just wheat—but has twice the glycemic index. When you eat spaghetti, you get a gentle rise in blood sugars. If you eat the exact same ingredients made into bread form, though, all the little bubbles in bread allow your body to break it down quicker; so, you get a big spike in blood sugars, which causes our body to over-react with an exaggerated insulin spike. And that actually ends up driving our blood sugars below fasting levels, and that can trigger hunger. Experimentally, if you infuse someone with insulin so their blood sugars dip, you can cause their hunger to spike and, in particular, hunger cravings for high-calorie foods. In short, lower-glycemic index foods may help one feel fuller longer than equivalent higher glycemic index foods. Researchers randomized individuals into one of three breakfast conditions: oatmeal made from quick oats, the same number of calories of Frosted Flakes, or just plain water, and then measured how much people ate for lunch three hours later. Not only did those who ate the oatmeal feel significantly fuller and less hungry… they indeed then went on to eat significantly less lunch. Overweight participants ate less than half as many calories at lunch after eating the oatmeal for breakfast, hundreds and hundreds of calories less. In fact, if you notice, the breakfast cereal was so unsatiating that the Corn Flakes group ate as much as the breakfast-skipping water-only group. It’s as if the cereal group hadn’t eaten breakfast at all! Feed people Honey Nut Cheerios, and hours later they feel significantly less full, less satisfied, and more hungry than those fed the same number of calories of oatmeal. Though both breakfasts were oat-based, the higher glycemic index, reduced intact starch, and reduced intact fiber in the Cheerios seemed to have all conspired to diminish appetite control. The trial was funded by the Pepsi Corporation, makers of the Quaker oatmeal, pitted against the Cheerios from rival General Mills. And an exposé on industry-funded study manipulation later revealed that the study originally included another arm, Quaker Oatmeal Squares. “I am sorry that the oat squares did not perform as well as hoped,” the researcher told Pepsi, which decided to publish only the results about its oatmeal.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'The remarkable impact of the structure of food beyond nutritional content or composition.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

And the physical form of food not only alters fat absorption, but carbohydrate absorption as well. For example, rolled oats have a significantly lower glycemic index than instant oatmeal, which is just oats but in thinner flakes. And oat flakes cause lower blood sugar and insulin spikes than powdered oats. Same single ingredient, oats, but in different forms can have different effects. Why do we care? Well, the overly rapid absorption of carbohydrates after eating a high-glycemic index meal can trigger “a sequence of hormonal and metabolic changes” that may promote excessive eating. They took a dozen obese teen boys and fed them different meals, each with the same number of calories, and just followed them for the next five hours to measure their subsequent food intake. And those that got the instant oatmeal went on to eat 53 percent more than after eating the same number of calories of steel-cut oatmeal. The instant oatmeal group was snacking within an hour after the meal and goes on to accumulate significantly more calories throughout the rest of the day. Same food, but different form, different effect. Instant oatmeal isn’t as bad as some breakfast cereals, though, which can get up into the 80s or 90s, even a cereal with zero sugar like shredded wheat. The new industrial methods used to create breakfast cereals such as extrusion cooking and explosive puffing accelerate starch digestion and absorption, causing an exaggerated blood sugar response, added sugar or not. Shredded wheat has the same ingredients as spaghetti— just wheat—but has twice the glycemic index. When you eat spaghetti, you get a gentle rise in blood sugars. If you eat the exact same ingredients made into bread form, though, all the little bubbles in bread allow your body to break it down quicker; so, you get a big spike in blood sugars, which causes our body to over-react with an exaggerated insulin spike. And that actually ends up driving our blood sugars below fasting levels, and that can trigger hunger. Experimentally, if you infuse someone with insulin so their blood sugars dip, you can cause their hunger to spike and, in particular, hunger cravings for high-calorie foods. In short, lower-glycemic index foods may help one feel fuller longer than equivalent higher glycemic index foods. Researchers randomized individuals into one of three breakfast conditions: oatmeal made from quick oats, the same number of calories of Frosted Flakes, or just plain water, and then measured how much people ate for lunch three hours later. Not only did those who ate the oatmeal feel significantly fuller and less hungry… they indeed then went on to eat significantly less lunch. Overweight participants ate less than half as many calories at lunch after eating the oatmeal for breakfast, hundreds and hundreds of calories less. In fact, if you notice, the breakfast cereal was so unsatiating that the Corn Flakes group ate as much as the breakfast-skipping water-only group. It’s as if the cereal group hadn’t eaten breakfast at all! Feed people Honey Nut Cheerios, and hours later they feel significantly less full, less satisfied, and more hungry than those fed the same number of calories of oatmeal. Though both breakfasts were oat-based, the higher glycemic index, reduced intact starch, and reduced intact fiber in the Cheerios seemed to have all conspired to diminish appetite control. The trial was funded by the Pepsi Corporation, makers of the Quaker oatmeal, pitted against the Cheerios from rival General Mills. And an exposé on industry-funded study manipulation later revealed that the study originally included another arm, Quaker Oatmeal Squares. “I am sorry that the oat squares did not perform as well as hoped,” the researcher told Pepsi, which decided to publish only the results about its oatmeal.')]","For managing high cholesterol, breakfast options that are high in fiber and low in saturated fats can be particularly beneficial. Here are some recommended choices based on the principles discussed in Dr. Michael Greger's videos:

1. **Oatmeal**: Starting the day with a bowl of oatmeal is excellent for lowering cholesterol. Oats contain beta-glucan, a type of soluble fiber that helps reduce LDL cholesterol (the ""bad"" cholesterol). Opt for steel-cut or old-fashioned rolled oats over instant oatmeal to avoid higher glycemic impacts, which can influence cholesterol levels negatively.

2. **Barley**: Like oats, barley is rich in beta-glucan and can be a good alternative to oatmeal. You can prepare it similarly to oats and add fruits, nuts, or seeds for additional nutrients.

3. **Whole Grain Cereals**: Choose whole grain cereals that are low in sugar and high in fiber. These cereals can help reduce cholesterol absorption and improve heart health.

4. **Nuts and Seeds**: Adding nuts like almonds or walnuts to your breakfast can be beneficial due to their healthy fats and fiber, both of which are known to help lower cholesterol. Seeds such as chia or flaxseeds can also be sprinkled over cereals or incorporated into smoothies.

5. **Fruits**: Incorporating fruits like berries, apples, or pears into your breakfast can add soluble fiber and antioxidants to your diet, aiding in cholesterol management.

6. **Plant-Based Yogurt**: Opt for plant-based yogurts made from almonds, coconut, or oats. These are typically lower in saturated fats compared to dairy yogurts and can be paired with fruits and nuts for a heart-healthy breakfast.

7. **Avocado**: Rich in monounsaturated fats and fiber, avocados can be used in various breakfast dishes, such as avocado toast on whole-grain bread, adding heart-healthy benefits.

8. **Legumes**: Incorporating legumes like beans or lentils into breakfast dishes, such as in a breakfast burrito with whole-grain wraps, can provide fiber and nutrients beneficial for cholesterol control.

These breakfast options not only help manage cholesterol but also contribute to overall heart health by providing essential nutrients and minimizing intake of unhealthy fats.","For managing high cholesterol, breakfast options that are high in fiber and low in saturated fats can be particularly beneficial.

Previously, I showed how a plant-based diet may prevent high blood pressure, but what if you already have it? The American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend as the first-line treatment: lifestyle modification. If that doesn\'t work you start the patient on a thiazide diuretic, water pill, and then you keep piling on the meds until you get their blood pressure down. Commonly people will end up on three drugs, though researchers are experimenting with four at a time, and some people end up on five. Why not jump straight to the drugs? Well, they don\'t treat the underlying cause, and they can cause side-effects. Less than half of patients stick with even the first-line drugs, perhaps due to the adverse effects such as erectile dysfunction, fatigue, and muscle cramps. So what are these recommended lifestyle changes? They recommend to control one\'s weight, salt, and alcohol intake, engage in regular exercise, and adopt a DASH eating plan. The DASH diet has been described as a lactovegetarian diet, but it\'s not. It emphasizes fruits and vegetables and low-fat dairy, but just a reduction in meat. Why not vegetarian? We\'ve known for decades that food of animal origin was highly significantly associated with blood pressure. In fact, if you take vegetarians, And you give them meat, you can watch their blood pressures go right up. I\'ve talked about how there are benefits to getting blood pressure down as low as 110 over 70, but who can get that low? Populations eating plant-based diets. Like in rural China, about 110 over 70 their whole lives, with meat only eaten on special occasions. Or rural Africa, where the elderly have perfect blood pressure as opposed to hypertension. In the Western world, as the American Heart Association has pointed out, the only folks really getting down that low were the strict vegetarians, coming out about 110 over 65. So when they created the DASH diet were they just not aware of this landmark research, done by Harvard\'s Frank Sacks? No, they were aware. The Chair of the Design Committee that came up with the DASH diet was Dr. Sacks. In fact the DASH diet was explicitly designed with the #1 goal of capturing the blood pressure lowering benefits of a vegetarian diet, yet contain enough animal products to make it palatable to the general public. In fact, Sacks found that the more dairy the lactovegetarians ate, the higher their blood pressures, but they had to make the diet acceptable. Research has since shown that it\'s the added plant foods, not the changes in oil, sweets, or dairy, that appears to be the critical component, so why not eat plant-based? A recent meta-analysis showed vegetarian diets were good, but strictly plant-based diets may be better. Vegetarian diets in general confer protection against cardiovascular diseases, some cancers and death, but completely plant-based diets seem to offer additional protection for obesity, hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and heart disease mortality. Based on a study of 89,000 people, those eating meat-free diets appeared to cut their risk of high blood pressure 55%, but those eating meat-free, egg-free, and dairy-free had 75% lower risk. If, however, you\'re already eating a whole food plant-based diet, no processed foods, no table salt, and you\'re still not hitting 110 over 70, there are a few foods recently found to offer additional protection. Ground flaxseeds, a few tablespoons a day, induced one of the most potent antihypertensive effects ever achieved by a dietary intervention, 2 to 3 times more powerful than instituting an aerobic endurance exercise program. Watermelon also appears to have extraordinary effects but you\'d have to eat like 2 pounds a day. Sounds like my kind of medicine, but it\'s hard to get year-round. Red wine may help, but only if the alcohol has been taken out. Raw vegetables or cooked? And the answer is both, though raw may work better. Beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils may help a little. Kiwifruits though don\'t seem to work at all, even though the study was funded by a kiwifruit company.

A thousand years later, researchers discovered that a single meal containing spinach could reduce blood pressure, thanks to its nitrate content-all green leafy vegetables are packed with the stuff, which our body can use to create nitric oxide that improves the flexibility and function of our arteries, which may be why eating our greens may be one of the most powerful things we can do to reduce our chronic disease risk. Just switching from low-nitrate vegetables to high-nitrate vegetables for a week can lower blood pressure by about 4 points. And, the higher the blood pressure started out with, the greater benefit they got. 4 points might not sound like a lot, but even a 2-point drop in blood pressure could prevent more than 10,000 fatal strokes every year here in the U.S. Potassium-rich foods may also act via a similar mechanism. If we just get the minimum recommended daily intake of potassium, we might prevent 150,000 strokes every year, because potassium appears to increase the release of nitric oxide. One week of eating two bananas and a large baked potato every day significantly improved arterial function. Even a single high-potassium meal, containing the equivalent of 2 to 3 bananas worth of potassium, can improve the function of our arteries. Whereas, a high-sodium meal, which is to say a meal with the amount of salt most people eat, can impair arterial function within 30 minutes. While potassium increases nitric oxide release, sodium reduces nitric oxide release. So, the health of our arteries may be determined by our sodium to potassium ratio. Two slices of bacon worth of sodium and our arteries take a significant hit within 30 minutes, but add three bananas worth of potassium, and you can counteract the effects of the sodium. When we evolved, we were eating 10 times more potassium than sodium; now, the ratio is reversed, more sodium than potassium. These kinds of studies provide additional evidence that increases in dietary potassium should be encouraged. What does that mean? More beans, sweet potatoes, and leafy greens, which are like a double whammy, high in potassium and nitrates. This recommendation to eat spinach from the 900s is pretty impressive, though they also recommended bloodletting and abstaining from sex; so, we should probably take ancient wisdom with a grain of salt, but our meals should be added-salt free.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""High blood pressure, the #1 killer risk factor in the world, may be eliminated with a healthy enough diet.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

The downside of me just covering whatever pops up in the literature is that some really fundamental topics may not get immediate coverage. \n\nHaving a “normal” blood pressure may set one up for dying from “normal” causes such as heart attacks and strokes. For more on this concept, see When Low Risk Means High Risk (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/when-low-risk-means-high-risk/). It’s like having a normal cholesterol level. See Optimal Cholesterol Level (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/optimal-cholesterol-level/).\nSo it seems high blood pressure is a choice. Like cavities, or heart disease: Cavities and Coronaries: Our Choice (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/cavities-and-coronaries-our-choice/).\n\nEven end-stage malignant hypertension can be reversed with diet (thereby showing it was the diet and not other lifestyle factors that protected traditional plant-based populations).

The answer? Our best estimate: 299,521. Soda isn't just bad because it's empty calories, so it's not a health-promoting food. It appears to be an actively death-promoting food. Of course not as deadly as bacon, bologna, ham, hot dogs. 800,000 deaths every year, killing twice as many women than domestic violence, five times more people than all illegal drugs combined. But eating more whole grains could save 1.7 million lives every year. More vegetables, 1.8 million lives. If only we ate more nuts and seeds, two and a half million lives saved, but fruit is apparently what the world needs most (they didn't look at beans). 4.9 million lives hang in the balance every year, and the cure is not drugs or vaccines; the cure is fruit. One reason why plant-based diets can save so many millions is because the #1 killer risk factor in the world is high blood pressure, laying to waste 9 million people year after year. In the United States, high blood pressure affects nearly 78 million -- that's one in three of us -- and as we age our pressures get higher and higher, such that by age 60, it strikes more than half. If it affects most of us when we get older, maybe it's less a disease and more just a natural, inevitable consequence of aging? No. We've known for nearly a century that high blood pressure need never occur. Researchers measured the blood pressure of a thousand people in rural Kenya who ate a diet centered around whole plant foods: whole grains, beans, vegetables, fruit, and dark green leafies. Up until age 40, the blood pressures of rural Africans were about the same as Europeans and Americans, down around 120s over 80s, but as Westerners age, their pressures creep up such that by age 60 the average person may be hypertensive, exceeding 140 over 90. But what about those not following the Western diet? Their pressures improved with age. Not only did they not develop hypertension, their blood pressures actually got better. The whole 140 over 90 cut-off is arbitrary. Just like studies show that the lower the cholesterol the better, there's really no safe cholesterol level above about 150. Blood pressure studies also support the kind of 'lower the better' approach to blood pressure reduction. Even people who start out with blood pressure under 120 over 80 appear to benefit from blood pressure reduction. But is it possible to get blood pressures under 110 over 70? It's not just possible, it's normal for those eating healthy enough diets. Over two years at a rural Kenyan hospital, 1800 patients were admitted. How many cases of high blood pressure did they find? Zero. Wow, so they must have had low rates of heart disease. No, they had no rates of heart disease. Not low risk, no risk. Not a single case of arteriosclerosis -- our #1 killer -- was found.""), Document(metadata={'description': ""Live Q&A on April 26th \n\nPlease see fan's pinned comment for topics and

salt I'm already processed foods and so I encourage people to stay away from any salty flavorings although look if you're eating all whole plant foods you know you can throw in some olives and still stay under that limit um but there's not much wiggle room biron Murphy asks Oh is responding to a question from maple flavor uh maple flavor would I consider doom or kitchen videos that's very kind of you to ask ah David they were very successful in terms of people seem to like them got lots of views um they're just such a pain they just take a lot of prep time um as anyone who's done cooking videos knows and so they're I have a whole list of all sorts of other cool ones I'd love to do yeah but it's just a matter of finding a time right now I'm in book mode working on the new manuscript but once that's done I'm going to do more webinars maybe I'll slip in some more cooking videos I'm glad you like them Marie Kessler asks pesticides from other sources oh you know rain onto our on a farm what do you do then what do you do is you choose organic that's yeah and reduce your pesticides I also have a DIY food and vegetable wash recipe on my facts org you can just type pesticide wash or fruit and vegetable wash and talk about ways you can reduce pesticides regardless whether you're buying conventional organic um and of course I emphasize in homeland I end in videos on the site that the the risk from pesticides is overwhelmed by the benefits of fruits and vegetables even eating lean most pesticide Laden fruits and vegetables we're talking Chilean imported grapes and bell peppers and spinach and strawberries it is still the benefits far outweigh the risk but you say what why accept any risk at all choose organic fantastic but we should never let concern about pesticides prevent us from stuffing her face full with as many fruits and vegetables as possible Rose Saxena as how much sodium oh there we go under 1500 milligrams I mentioned that before maple flavor says I think you're right about sucralose and then describes how her stools are without using it thank you for that byron Murphy asks Sicily consumes less protein you only need something amount and there is a protein almost every food oh maybe I think Byron is responding to somebody else raw sexiness is cereal a red light food ah depends what's earlier talking on most cereals are crap oh my god do you I mean they're just packed with sugar even like the so called healthy ones there's very few that actually don't have added sugar at itself but there are a few so for example Uncle Sam's I think only has two ingredients which is like rolled wheat and flax seeds oh and I think they have a berry one too acid free drug free strawberries but if you wanna but finding a cereal that actually complies with the five to one fiber rule um if you don't know what the five to one fiber rule is check out the video on that um it's almost impossible Uncle Sam's does it but very few others do um but if you if you're like oh but I really like granola or something make your own you can make your own and and not put your health in the in the hands of corporations that may not have your family's interests at heart maple flavor ass does the massive protein dump from being a plant-based source like eat protein powder without the fiber cause raised igf-1 certainly soy protein does so I believe Lydia talking about igf-1 insulin-like growth factor-1 a cancer growing and growth hormone which is your levels are boosted by animal protein consumption but also enough soy protein consumption but whether or not P protein has the amino acid profile that would raise igf-1 levels I have not looked into but there's no reason for anyone to take protein powders um you can get protein it's like saying well you get carbohydrate powder table sugar or fat powder which is basically oil right why get isolated sources of any of these when you can eat your nutrients in whole plant food all right um all right Oh light dark a snake poop question oh yeah the question is particularly cinnamon toast crunch yes that is a terrible choice but I should I should walk that back right it's always is compared to what is cinnamon toast crunch better than sausage and and eggs yes is it better than opening all not even close all right food isn't go to bed as so much as it is better or worse food is a zero-sum game everything you put in your mouth is a lost opportunity but something even healthier mouth Shushan we should always try to notch things up right Rose rose is sniffing this beautiful spring weather we're having here in DC okay oh I wish I'd get her up on the treadmill okay oh I bet I can turn the camera you want to see you want to see Rose when I had a rose hold on where's rose is that the wrong set no oh yeah Rose rose oh you can't that's not gonna work all right never mind okay never mind she'll bark at least you'll hear her yeah that didn't work okay um where are we here bjk asked when you eat raw broccoli in Mersin ace transforms glucoraphanin into Superman does any clue graph ernst ain't actin is so ba bla bla with the many benefits compared to just so for a fan um yes some stays intact but their benefits I think most of the benefits are from the that which is converted so I would just do all those tricks to convert that was a high level question I'm all for higher level questions if you don't know what I'm talking about you should go to my video second strategy something something something broccoli on nutrition facts that alright ah maple flavor as optimum protein to take for muscle growth 2.7 grams per pound of lean body weight it's actually well I don't know about that um I think she he or she is answering someone else's question point eight grams per kilogram body weight is what our what is our daily Reference intake for protein comes out to be about 50 grams a day a little more from and little less for women okay be JK is okay to eat to drink green tea right after brushing your teeth might it mess with the wind mineralization no it would actually help with remineralization because green tea is a natural source of fluoride okay um looks like Byron is responding to somebody and then GRC VGC is back asking are there natural multi vitamins worth taking there are no multivitamins worth taking as far as I'm concerned um ah unless science comes up says that they're helpful which on so far is sorely lacking although I have not done a video on it and while so maybe there's new research I will get to it my that is in I don't know if that's under V or M I've just started that my new surge through the alphabet so I just have a lot of videos coming up over the next week's on acne and berries and beans and but if you're our favorite food is zucchini you're gonna be waiting a while alright bro sexy Nass should we not eat plant-based foods high with contamination I assume they're talking about pesticide contamination like you cover lettuce grapes and mushrooms cucumbers are among the least nutrient dense foods same with lettuce but green light whole plant foods very low and clora density we should not stay away from any whole plant foods we should eat them up though they're always healthier choices so healthier choice than cucumber and lettuce would be a darker green so so particularly when lettuce is contaminated like romaine lettuce is newly Cola how about arugula on your salad or baby spinach somewhere darker is better alright okay there's a lot of responding to questions light dark zero zero says mushroom no and that's not a question Oh Rebecca asked what do I feel about immunotherapy for allergies last time I checked it's very controversial I don't know what the latest is sorry I can't help with that a lot of answers answers Oh what AIDS sleep best and deals of anxiety are we talking about stress management in my I haven't got to that section yet but most uh in terms of sleep its I do have some videos about melatonin we just found naturally a number of plant foods like strawberries and Tour cherries if I remember correctly but most of healthy sleeping is really sleep hygiene want a dark you want it cool and quiet and there's a bunch of things you if you type in sleep hygiene Google get a lot of good tips this certainly are foods that may help oh but what was the one food what's the pistachios something there's one that's just off the charts in terms of melatonin i the videos are coming up have videos on how to help with jetlag and light therapy and melatonin therapy but you do not want to take melatonin supplements that's something I learned oh and it's a really kind of scary reason why but melatonin foods and get the benefits without the risk in this one food that's just crazy off the chart I think specialist I'd have to check and you can check by checking out the video which should be coming up eventually maybe Wow ok Turtles Rodriguez si like I eat like dr. Michael Greger and my blood pressure still freakin elevated heart rate I'm 80 beats per minute it's too high can someone help me on the one my body's so stupid when everyone is thriving so in so if you are eating a hopeful pump each day and still have elevated blood pressure so my patients have been the situation typically they're actually eating - what sodium they when they say the really hopeful pump ace often they say well I don't eat meat dairy eggs or very frequently but they still may be eating packaged junk food some butch has left so you wouldn't even know lots of stuff has salt in it I'm so cut their salt down it still doesn't make it and you're really arguing whole plant foods diet center a whole plant foods and there are some foods that can draw people of pressure lower I talked about ground flaxseeds I talked about hibiscus tea and herbal tea you can take the drops blood pressure's down so just check out the chapter um how not to die""), Document(metadata={'description': ""Replay of Dr. Greger's live Q&A on Thursday, August 24.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n\n0:42 Will you update your yoga research?\n\n1:52 What can I do to limit my exposure to radiation from CT and PetScans that I have to do?\n\n4:12 My HDL is too low.

my treadmill instead of every month and answer any questions you may have for those of you unfamiliar with my work every year I read through every issue of every English language nutrition journal in the world so busy folks like you don't have to I think about the most interesting most groundbreaking most practical findings to new videos and articles that upload nearly every day on my non-profit site nutritionfacts.org everything on the website is free there are no ads no corporate sponsorship strictly non-commercial not selling anything just put it up as a public service as a labor of love as a tribute to my grandmother whose own life was saved with evidence-based nutrition all right let's get to your questions I'll just go down the list here first question is from kawar uh yoga webinar um uh I talked about the evidence um based uh presumably on a meta-analysis that covered up into 2020 what about any of the latest um uh so right now on nutritionfacts.org there is a yoga series a six part video series um I probably you know what I do is I go through Topics by alphabet um and so uh I'm almost at the end of the alphabet with with yoga um and then I start again so you'll see videos on apples and videos on you know as we go through so yoga is going to be a while but uh we'll uh when it gets its turn I'll check to see if there's anything juicy um uh there may be a lot of new science but if it basically shows what we've already seen doesn't cover any new diseases came to the same inclusions as before I'll probably skip it um same thing with apples if there's no new good apple stuff that's you know stick with what we know um uh but if there's anything really juicy um I will do more about it since uh it uh people seem to be interested all right next question uh it's from Tasha saying hello what can I do to limit my exposure to radiation oh uh from CT pet scans uh which have to monitor your condition told to take melatonin what does the sign say I do have some uh videos on what to do to cut down on the risk from ionizing radiation of course the primary one is to reduce your exposure in the first place I don't know if they can uh uh if they can stagger them out anymore that may or may not be possible um but if I remember from the video so if you just type in ionizing radiation or probably just radiation and nutritionfacts.org those videos will come up if I remember correctly I think greens um dark green leaf and vegetables presumably maybe only cruciferous I'm not sure I remember it's the only reason I remember is because uh it's one of the reasons I eat kale chips uh when I travel because when you're up in the air that high you're exposed to more cosmic rays and so you actually get quite a really I mean you don't get anywhere near a CT scan dose but uh uh you do actually get a a large relative amount dose of radiation when you uh trap when you fly um for prolonged periods and so I remember thinking oh my kale chips are perfect for this um and so if I remember correctly there's like an X Vivo study where they basically take people's blood um before and after eating greens or took uh or randomized people to eat greens or not and then exposed their um uh white blood cells so they then they took blood from them uh before and after grains and uh exposed them to uh a whopping dose radiation at the people but the blood cells and could show less DNA damage in those who had been eating grains and again I don't remember it's all grains are just cruciferous grains but that suggests that it can either boost DNA repair enzymes or maybe just to make the DNA more robust in the first place um or some kind of DNA protection mechanism but anyway um and it wasn't just greens or other food so check it out nutrition facts or pop right up sorry I don't remember but um I have to clear out space in my brain for all the new stuff coming down and just put everything up in videos and books and move on to the next thing okay next up Johnny says uh ldl2 low um I'm into ACL too low excuse me LDL 54. no you are not okay oh I'm so glad you asked that I kind of misconception um uh no you are um uh in an excellent position with an LDL at 54. um that's really what we are concerned about we used to think that uh HDL was a causal um uh uh kind of inverse respect meaning that we thought having high ACL actually protects you um from heart disease having high HDL is associated um with uh lower rates of heart disease um but the question is is it a causal risk factor or not so I actually did a video this is one of my kind of coconut oil videos if you just type in HDL it'll pop up but basically it was like um just like uh having I think I use the example I use having tennis shoes in a house is correlated with um uh you know with with exercise or having ashtrays in the house having lots of tennis shoes associated with longer life um having lots of ashtrays in the house associated with shorter live and uh but it's not that the ashtrays are hurting you it's just the ashtrays um are are pointing to a pointing to the real cause effector which in that case uh maybe tobacco use and similarly exercise is really what's helping him um and so just got some things correlated with something doesn't mean it causes something um and so that's why we have for example mendelian randomization studies where you know just from a kind of genetic random Lottery some of us are born with genes that give us lifelong elevated levels of HDL or low levels of HDL or high levels of LDL at low levels of LDL and so like regardless of what we eat regardless of whatever we just have the kind of a kind of lower levels if we were eating those same Foods or living that same lifestyle with different genes and so since that kind of genealog and it's kind of random at Birth depending on which egg cell and which sperm cell kind of got together it's kind of like a randomized controlled trial where people are like randomized have Heil deal or loyaldale at Birth kind of lifelong levels and the question is wait a second do they live longer or shorter lives so when it comes to LDL absolutely um you are just have lifelong LDL you dramatically increase risk of dying prematurely of heart disease um in fact uh um you actually have three times more benefit um having lower LDL through um through genetic Means versus Statin means or or medication means just because it's lower for longer we want to have low LDL as long as possible I'm not just starting drugs later in life though that certainly can be helpful if your levels are too high anyway so that's one of the reasons we know LDL causes um uh heart disease so okay what about people born with high HDL if it is indeed cause and effect then people should have less heart disease and turns out they don't um and so uh hos uh kind of a marker of heart health but not cause and effect so raising HCL and so no wonder the trials where they had drugs that raise ACL actually people were in one particular drug people dying more than those who didn't wear on the drug um so across the board all drug all uh drug trials to raise ACL have flopped and now we know why oh well because having pushing HDL higher doesn't actually make things better but pushing LDL lower definitely does again based on these studies there's lots of other kind of studies that we can look at but anyway so we used to worry about the low HCL um uh and like what can we do to raise it like exercise and other things um but uh it turns out that what we care about primarily LDL you can argue that APO B uh there's kind of our uh which is kind of the protein component of LDL and the LDL and IDL but um uh uh LDL is cheaper and probably better recognized although it's very that's in a common lipid panel that's what we care about is what your LDL is doing and your LDL is fantastic congratulations okay Jeff says watch my sold intake um could slightly elevated blood pressure because my stress and Mild anxiety we're taking Gaba and magnesium supplements currently taking magnesium malate um um probably the most important thing is you are not watching your salt intake enough um when people think about oh I don't need a lot of salt they're thinking about the salt that they may add in the kitchen or the dining room but in here in the U.S and it's different around the world but here in the U.S 70 75 somewhere around there of all sodium that people eat has nothing to do with the salt shaker um it has to do with processed foods um and so and when by say processed using like bread bread is leading source of sodium they had a lot of sodium to bread um and uh I think chicken is actually the number one um contributor of sodium intake between like ages 30 and 50 if I remember correctly and you're saying like wait a second like salted chicken no just regular chicken because they actually injected with salt water so it uh retains more water weight because it's sold by the pound so they make more money that way but of course all that salt and phosphate additives no good for us so uh you may think you're doing good on sodium but if you're eating processed foods you're probably not so I would make sure that you get your sodium under 1500 milligrams a day which is the American Heart Association recommendation so I would start there before worrying about other things you can do and before going to supplements I would start eating Foods um that can have been shown to lower your blood pressure I mean if you really want magnesium I want to your dark green leafy vegetables instead um and uh so hibiscus tea um can lower blood pressure a few strong cups in the morning uh better than works better than um uh leading blood pressure drug uh ground flax seeds can lower blood pressure bunch of other stuff uh so just type in blood pressure and nutrition facts that we're going to bring up those foods but again why don't we treat the cause first lower the sodium intake and then see how you're doing um and if necessary add healthy foods to the""), Document(metadata={'description': 'A whole food plant-based diet can be used to help lock in the benefits of fasting to kickstart the

A hundred seventy-four  consecutive patients were treated in an inpatient setting. First, a few days of fruits and vegetables. This is to kind of clear out the gut so they don\'t become constipated, followed by 10 or 11 days of water-only fasting, before transitioning them back to a whole food plant-based diet: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, which are beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils, and nuts and seeds, with no animal products, processed foods or added salt, oil, or sugar. They all came in hypertensive, over 140/90, but 9 out of 10, 89%, walked out with pressures under 140/90. The average reduction in systolic blood pressure was 37 points, which is remarkable compared to other interventions, including drugs. And that was just the average drop. Those that came in with really high pressures, like over 180, experienced a 60-point drop. This is arguably the largest effect ever published in the scientific literature. And that was after they had all stopped all their blood pressure medications. They conclude that medically supervised water-only fasting appears to be a safe and effective means of normalizing blood pressure. I explored the safety in a  previous video, and yes, extraordinarily effective,  but for how long? I mean, fasting is the least sustainable diet out there. Interestingly, when they resumed feeding them, their blood pressures dropped even further, suggesting fasting could be used to kickstart the normalization of blood pressure and then you could keep it down from then on with a healthy enough diet. They were able to track down a few dozen patients much later, and on average their pressures remained down. We don\'t know what happened to the rest, but it shows that at least it can provide more lasting benefits for some. A subsequent smaller study followed up people up to a year later, and the blood pressure reduction seemed to hold, along with the weight loss, so presumably they stuck with the healthier diet. Now, no one should be fasting for more than a day or two unsupervised, so this treatment certainly carries a cost, but the entire cost appears to have just been recouped within the first year just from decreased medical care costs alone. An alternative is the Buchinger method of fasting, popular in Europe, where instead of water only, people get like 300 calories a day of fruit juice and vegetable broth. It still needs to be done under professional supervision, but at least people don\'t have to take time off work. People are randomized to seven days of that and then followed up four months later. After four months you\'d think any benefit from the one week quasi-fast would have disappeared, but their blood pressures ended up fifteen points lower than the control group. Although long-term follow-up of these subjects has been sporadic, the available data suggest that these large reductions in blood pressure can be conserved in patients who remain compliant with the follow-up diet. In other words, a \'cure\' for hypertension may be feasible though, of course, if they resumed the original diet that had made them hypertensive in the first place that would presumably lead to a resurgence of their blood pressures. And the fast may actually help with that. The preliminary fast may help people stick to healthier diets that would ordinarily have little appeal to people accustomed to meretriciously salty and greasy meals— that is an SAT word if I ever saw one. I had to Google that one: Apparently attractive but having in reality no value. Sounds about right. The secret to long-term benefits may be in helping kickstart the healthier diet by cleansing our palate, which has been so deadened by hypersweet, hypersalty, hyperfatty foods. After not eating for a week, your regular, normal, healthy real food tastes good again. Like the ripest peach in the world would taste sour after a bowl of Fruit Loops, but fasting may re-sensitize our taste buds such that you can enjoy something like corn on the cob without the added butter and salt, so you get the best of both worlds: tastes great and less killing.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Eating a diet low enough in sodium (salt) can prevent the rise in hypertension risk as we age.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

We went millions of years without salt shakers, and so our bodies evolved into salt conserving machines, which served us well until we discovered salt could be used to preserve foods. Without refrigeration, this was a big boon to human civilization. Of course this may have led to a general rise in blood pressure, but who cares if the alternative is starving to death since all your food rotted away. But where does that leave us now, when we no longer have to live off of pickles and jerky? We are genetically programmed to eat ten times less salt than we do now. Even many low salt diets can be considered high salt diets. That’s why it’s critical to understand what the concept of “normal” is when it comes to salt. Having a “normal” salt intake can lead to a “normal” blood pressure, which can help us to die from all the “normal” causes, like heart attacks and strokes. Doctors used to be taught that a “normal” systolic blood pressure is approximately 100 plus age. “Systolic” blood pressure means the top number, and indeed that’s about what we’re born with. Babies start out with a blood pressure around like 95 over 60, but then as we age that 95 can go to 120 by our 20’s then 140 in our 40’s (the official cut-off for high blood pressure), and keep climbing as we age. That was considered normal, since everyone’s blood pressure creeps up as we get older. And if that’s normal then heart attacks and strokes are normal too since risk starts rising once we start getting above the 100 we had as a baby. But if blood pressures over a 100 are associated with disease, maybe they should be considered abnormal, perhaps caused by our abnormally high salt intake— ten times more than what our bodies were designed to handle. Maybe if we just ate a natural amount of salt, our blood pressures naturally would not go up with age, and we’d be protected. Of course to test that theory you’d have to find a population in modern times that doesn’t use salt or eat processed food or go out to eat. For that you’d have to go deep into the Amazon rainforest. Meet the Yanomamo people, a no-salt culture. Lowest salt intake ever reported, which is to say normal-for- our-species salt intake. And so what happens to their blood pressure? They start out with a blood pressure of about 100 over 60 and end up with a blood pressure of about 100 over 60. Though theirs is described as a salt deficient diet, that’s like saying they have a diet deficient in Twinkies. They’re the ones, it seems, eating normal salt intakes apparently leading to truly normal blood pressures. Those in their 50’s have the blood pressure of a 20 year old. The percentage of the population tested that had high blood pressure? Zero. Whereas elsewhere in Brazil, up to 38% of the population may be affected. The Yanomamos probably represent the ultimate human example of the importance of salt on blood pressure. But look it could have been other factors: they didn’t drink alcohol, ate a high-fiber, plant-based diet, lots of exercise, no obesity. There’s a number of plant-based populations eating little salt that experience no rise in blood pressure as they age, so how do we know what exactly is to blame? Ideally we’d do an interventional trial. Imagine,  if you took people literally dying from out of control high blood pressure, so called malignant hypertension where you go blind from bleeding into your eyes, your kidneys shut down, your heart fails, and then you withhold from those people blood pressure medications so their fate is certain death, and THEN you put them on a Yanomamo level of salt intake, a normal-for-the-human- species salt intake, and if instead of dying, they walked away cured of their hypertension, that would pretty much seal the deal. Enter, Dr. Walter Kempner and his rice and fruit diet. Patients came in with blood pressures of 210 over 140 dropping down to 80 over 60. Now, the reason he could ethically withhold all modern blood pressure medications and treat with diet alone? The drugs hadn’t been invented yet— this was back in the 1940’s. Now, the diet wasn’t just extremely low salt, but strictly plant-based, extremely low fat, protein, and calories. But there is no doubt that Kempner’s rice diet achieved remarkable results and Kempner is now remembered as the person who demonstrated beyond any shadow of a doubt that high blood pressure can often be lowered by a low enough salt diet. Forty years ago it was acknowledged that the evidence is very good if not conclusive that a low enough reduction of salt in the diet would result in the prevention of essential hypertension— that rising of blood pressure as we age— and its disappearance as a major public health problem. It looks like we knew how to stop this four decades ago. In that time, how many people have died? Today, high blood pressure may wipe out 400,000 Americans every year. 1,000 unnecessary deaths every day.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Here is the latest research on the effect of fasting to lower blood pressure naturally compared to medications, cutting down on alcohol, meat and salt, eating more fruits and vegetables, or eating completely plant-based.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

I did a previous video series about the studies on using fasting for weight loss back in the ‘70s. Was it safe? Was it effective? But what about fasting for treating and preventing other diseases? One of the side effects noticed in the early weight loss studies was a consistent fall in blood pressure, so much so you typically have to stop taking blood pressure medications while fasting or else your pressures fall too low. Once you start eating again, your pressures go back up, but remarkably, not as high as they were before. But, of course, it depends on what you start eating again. For example, a case report  of a woman who used fasting to drive her rheumatoid arthritis into remission. Systolic blood pressure started up around 170 despite multiple blood pressure medications was put on a whole food plant- based diet for eight weeks. That dropped her down from 170 down to 130, off of all medications before starting the fast, and then normalizing down to 110 after the fast. But is that just because of all the weight loss? She lost 22 pounds on the fast, and 27 pounds on the plant-based diet. So yeah, it’s extraordinary to drop your pressures from 170 to 110, but that was after losing about 50 pounds. We’ve known for decades that any kind of weight loss can lower blood pressure. Even minor weight loss can lower blood pressures in obese persons, even if they remain significantly overweight. But most of the drop in blood pressures with severe caloric restriction happens within the first two days, before significant loss of body fat; so, it may also be a reduction in the fight-or-flight stress hormones, like adrenaline and noradrenaline both before… and after exercise, after just two weeks of just a few hundred calories a day. So, that may be one reason why a very-low-calorie diets have been found useful in lowering blood pressures even in those for whom blood pressure medications fail: the changes in those hormones. But, low calorie diets also tend to be more plant-based; so, there’s fiber and potassium- rich foods, less saturated fat. Even just adding fruits and vegetables to the diets of hypertensives can lower their systolic blood pressure— the top number—by 7 points. That’s the kind of blood pressure improvement you might get losing 10 pounds, just by eating more fruits and vegetables. And, if you combine that with a drop in meat consumption, not only doubling fruit and vegetable intake but combining that with trying to slash saturated fat and cholesterol, you can cut pressures by 11 points. What else can we do? Restricting alcohol intake in regular daily drinkers can drop you 5 points. So, let’s keep track here: alcohol restriction can drop your systolic blood pressure 5 points, losing ten pounds can drop you 7, as can just eating the recommended 8 to 10 servings of fruits and vegetables a day. Regular aerobic exercise for at least 3 months can drop you 9…. So, let’s add that on to the chart. Combine the fruits and vegetables with meat reduction and you can drop it 11. Blood pressure medications can have side effects, but on their own can drop pressures by 15 points. What about cutting down on salt? Note in the other diet study they kept the sodium levels the same. Cut sodium enough and it can edge out drugs at 16: the drugs 15, sodium restriction 16. Is that the best we can do with diet? Put people on a purely plant-based diet, even one moderate in sodium, and you can drop hypertensives by 18 points even after 9 out of 10 reduced their blood pressure medications or stopped them entirely, all within just 7 days. That’s pretty impressive. Now, what if you took that same diet, but added fasting? 37 points! We’ll review that study and others like it, next.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Extraordinary results reported in a rare example of a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of a dietary intervention (flaxseeds) to combat one of our leading killers, high blood pressure.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

For these reasons, these  meat consumers look  for healthier food alternatives  as a means to maintain good health. So, this represents a good opportunity for  the industry to develop some new products.  Natural foods could be added to meat  to reach those health-oriented consumers  by boosting antioxidants  levels, for example.  Foods like flax seeds  and tomatoes are healthy,  associated with reduced risks of  cancer and cardiovascular disease.  So by making flaxy tomato burgers,  they figure they can reduce saturated  fat intake and less sugar somehow?  It’s like their flaxseed fed pork  idea to produce “enriched lard.”  Wouldn’t it be easier to just cut out the  middle-pig and eat flax seeds ourselves? Flax seeds have been described as a “miraculous  defense against some critical maladies.”  Now, I’m a fan of flax, but this  title seemed a bit over exuberant. I figured something just  got lost in translation,  but then I saw this study and realized  maybe that title is not too far off. Rarely do we see a dietary  study of this caliber.  A prospective, double-blinded,  placebo-controlled, randomized trial— you know how hard that  is in a nutrition study?  I mean, for drugs it’s easy:  you take two identical looking pills –  one’s active, one’s placebo –  and until the end of the study  neither the researcher nor the patient  has any idea which is which,  hence double blind.  But people tend to notice  what they’re eating.  So how do you sneak a quarter  cup of ground flaxseeds  into half of peoples’ diets  without them knowing it?  They created these various flax  or placebo containing foods,  and even added like bran and molasses  to match the color and texture  so it was all a big secret  until 6 months later  when they broke the code  to see who ate which. Why test it on hypertension?  Because having a systolic blood pressure  over 115 – that’s the top number –  may be the single most important  determinant for death in the world today.  If you take a bunch of older folks,  most of them on an array of blood pressure  pills, and don’t improve their diet at all,  despite the drugs they may start out, on average,   hypertensive and stay hypertensive 6 months later.  But those who were unknowingly  eating ground flaxseeds every day  dropped their systolic blood  pressure about 10 points,  and their diastolic, the lower  number, by about 7 points.  That might not sound like a lot,  but a drop like that could cut stroke  risk 46%, heart disease 29%,  and that 10-point drop in the top number could have   a similar effect on strokes and heart attacks.  And for those that started out  over 140, they got a 15-point drop.  In summary, flax seed induced  one of the most potent  antihypertensive effects ever  achieved by a dietary intervention.  In other words, the magnitude of  this decrease in blood pressure,  demonstrated by dietary flax seed,  is as good or better than any  other nutritional interventions,  and comparable to many drugs, which  can have serious side effects.  And they’re not exaggerating  about the comparable to drugs bit.  The flax dropped systolic  and diastolic up to 15 and 7.  Compare that to powerful  ACE inhibitors like Vasotec,  which may only drop  pressures 5 and 2.  Calcium channel blockers like  Norvasc or Cardizem, 8 and 3 –  half of what the flax could do.  And side effects include…  Compare this list to that to  the side effect of flaxseeds:  its pleasant nutty flavor.  During the 6-month trial there were  strokes and heart attacks in both groups.  Even if the flax seeds can  cut risk in half, though,  any avoidable risk is unacceptable.  Well, isn’t high blood pressure  just inevitable as we get older?  No, the prevalence of hypertension does increase  dramatically with age, but not for everyone.  People who eat more plant-based diets or  keep their salt intake low enough  tend not to exhibit any change in  blood pressure with advancing age.  So, you know, flax is great, but always better   to prevent the disease in the first place.')]","For someone diagnosed with borderline hypertension, adopting a diet rich in whole plant-based foods can be highly beneficial in managing and potentially lowering blood pressure. Here are some specific food recommendations based on Dr. Michael Greger's insights and research findings:

1. **Whole Grains**: Consuming whole grains like oats, barley, and brown rice can have a positive effect on blood pressure.

2. **Leafy Greens**: Foods high in nitrates, like spinach, arugula, and other leafy greens, can help improve arterial function and reduce blood pressure.

3. **Berries**: Berries are rich in antioxidants and have been shown to decrease blood pressure.

4. **Flaxseeds**: Ground flaxseeds are particularly potent in lowering blood pressure. They can be added to smoothies, oatmeal, or yogurt.

5. **Beets and Beetroot Juice**: These are high in nitric oxide, which can help open blood vessels and lower blood pressure.

6. **Legumes**: Beans, lentils, chickpeas, and other legumes are beneficial for heart health and blood pressure management.

7. **Nuts and Seeds**: A moderate intake of nuts and seeds can be beneficial due to their healthy fats and minerals.

8. **Fruits and Vegetables**: A diet high in fruits and vegetables has been shown to lower blood pressure. Aim for a variety of colors and types.

9. **Hibiscus Tea**: Drinking hibiscus tea can be an effective way to lower systolic blood pressure.

It's also important to reduce intake of processed foods, added sugars, and high-sodium products, which can negatively impact blood pressure. Regular physical activity and maintaining a healthy weight are also crucial components of managing hypertension. As always, it's recommended to consult with a healthcare provider before making significant dietary changes, especially when managing health conditions like hypertension.","For someone diagnosed with borderline hypertension, adopting a diet rich in whole plant-based foods can be highly beneficial in managing and potentially lowering blood pressure.

Michael Greger coming to you live from my treadmill to answer any questions you may have I like I do every month I just did Facebook live at the 1 p.m. and and so if I didn't answer any questions I hope you're back I'm gonna hope to get to it this time I did mention on the Facebook I was just hanging out with our monthly newsletter today which is free like everything else in nutrition facts I've already if you're not subscribed good nutrition facts that or click Subscribe and you won't miss it one of the things we did today is announced a flash sale the next five days I've all sorts of cool new merchandise new shirts and stuff of course all money proceeds we get from that all goes to support our nonprofit Marquette nutrition facts that or if I want C 3 charity fueled all by your donations alright I'm for those young familiar in my work every year right through every issue very English substitution journal they're also busy folks like you don't have to I think about limo situation most grand bag most practical finding some new videos and articles every day I compiled so there were new videos I already said that on the latest in evidence-based nutrition all the most interesting practical findings you've heard the drill normally I just say all that to get the questions going on Facebook but questions there's already along this equation so I'm just gonna skip to the chase and get right to your questions first questions from Melinda and not a question dollar just says ie depo-provera I assume she had a question before that I was trying to clarify but I think if you put a question on too early I'm on YouTube it just cuts it off for whatever reason so sorry but first full question I have is from automaton 111 saying anything food related that can improve the quality of my sleep no he he or she knows about pistachios and melatonin um that's exciting I didn't know about stashes in melatonin but yeah you're coming out about that very exciting unless I already came up with the video about that um I didn't think that was up yet anyway um I do have video on kiwifruits um and sleep I forget what the control group was in that that study I don't type in sleep nutrition packs that or all my videos will come up I've yet to write my sleep chapter in my new book I am finished 122 thousand words out of the estimated hundred and seventy three thousand and final manuscript so I'm about 70% done I haven't got sleep yet though but when I do I'm sure I'm also it's a new exciting research we shall not only put in the book but translate into videos later on so everyone can enjoy em see Sebastian has dearest dr. Greger okay please tell them about the best plant-based strategy for bad arthritis okay so the question is what kind of arthritis do you have mentioned that there was a family history so room well I would guess it doesn't really matter rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis actually very similar diet seems to help with both a diet packed with anti-inflammatory foods might so whole food plant-based diet we have decent date on rheumatoid arthritis at least knee osteoarthritis there's not much on certain other types of arthritis like ankylosing spondylitis but I certainly can't hurt seems a nice healthy anti-inflammatory diet but as always got treat the cause there she affects just causes that that don't need diet they need antibiotics so you need to find out what's causing arthritis and hopefully try to to treat the cause although a healthy diet will help regardless with your life because it's a healthy diet elite a lean e Li any and asks what is the best strategy for going out birth control pill previously covered in very persistent acne after quitting usually that's temporary and should kind of equilibrate or at least has been in my experience innocent lamb looked into I do have some videos on treating acne like with barberries I was just talking about in the other on the other QA but again I don't know if there's some protocol that would make that less likely Louis Mahon as how often do we need to replenish antioxidant levels so it makes sense to put some amla powder in glass and water I bring to bed and sit during the night um you don't have this really and what I found to be intriguing serious Nvidia on like what's your RDA for antioxidants like what's the recommended daily allowance I think it's a series of three videos where I talk about how the targets for men and women in terms of how my on antioxidant unisys you get every day and then I go through all the different foods all right well if when you did 15,000 or whatever how you gonna do it okay here's your oatmeal this is where you get to and if you had a little cinnamon boof all of a sudden you're up to here and there's and then so I check out those videos I bet if you take just type in antioxidants into nutrition facts that are hard we actually just updated our search engine and this month I think last month so it's really much nicer than it used to be Thank You Christy and so you should be able to find those those series of videos on exactly how much you need how to reach it and as you'll see in those videos it's super easy to do it but you just have to eat really healthy foods so no there's no reason you need to sip on some special glass of Amla water you can get all the antioxidants you need from foods if you eat healthy enough and those videos will help you do that emcee sebastian asks is five milligrams melatonin supplements daily long-term safe there's so much scientific evidence about benefits but their concern that hormones declining as age do not take notes supplements um y-you say well just trust me until the video the videos already I don't know I can look it up I'm let me see if it's in then this next batch of videos um volume we're up to volume 43 can you believe that oh yeah here it is video 4319 our melatonin supplements safe alright so where are we now oh we are on three so in 16 videos 16 videos from today our melatonin supplements safe so you can see all the data and why but spoiler it cut to the chase don't take melatonin supplements you'll find out in 16 videos all right hacks I'm 21 says please talk about 9 Jen I've never heard of night Jen can't talk about it hex I'm 21 says or NAD+ I can talk about I'd presumably as a supplement my NAD+ is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide i think that it's a coenzyme in the body your body makes it you don't need to eat it no reason take supplement but I bet the people that are trying to sell you NAD+ have a different opinion Louis Mellon says is there any evidence eating in season foods is healthier or that like different ethnic groups are particularly suited for different foods and the answer is no no I guess n-no so in season foods well so there may be environmental benefits too you know buying locally in season but but if you just care about your health the fact that we can eat blueberries all year round without even having to get you be probably fresh blueberries all year round I'm so of course you can just see some frozen that's a wonderful thing about our modern world and that you know I have to do live off of like turnips during the winter and so yeah eat healthy foods all year-round period would be my take on that in terms of ethnic groups eating different foods I mean it's remarkable that around the world people eat vastly different diets but you know but the reason we know that people aren't somehow kind of their genetics have something new it is because of these migration studies where you take people I take someone lives in Japan they moved to San Francisco even living like a San Franciscan and they start dying from all these San Francisco diseases and less of these so they you know their prostate cancer rates shoot up if their man the but their stomach cancer rates you down this all the sudden they're not dating all this little salted fermented veggies that they were eating in Japan anyway so no we we're all humans and healthy food is healthy food regardless of what kind of human you are e Moana Beach says one of the best ways to increase saliva Munna says talks about a dry mouth due to anxiety and so the pureed foods liquids and I try the food I hold my breath is alive isn't breaking down can help okay increase love so what I would do is whether it's actually conditioned there's a variety of conditions that can actually cause dry mouth and so there's person salivary glands or section now the muta C's that can do it seem to go to your doctor find out what it is so you can treat the cause and if it is anxiety then there's things you can do to treat anxiety so it's not about well I'm just gonna eat lots of wet food no let's treat the cause find out what's causing the first place treat that so then you can eat any kind of healthy food you want um okay um una asks how to breathe when there's no air gets into distress sounds like an like hangs a panic attack uh yeah it sounds like a panic attack but you need to go get treated for panic attacks it's a horrible horrible sensation unfortunately I don't think there's anything there's been no studies I'm aware of on diet and panic attacks no there are one can imagine lifestyle interventions something like stress management maybe meditation things like that things which I am no expert and so I am not familiar with that literature but hopefully on your physician can point you in the right direction Maria ve asked top recommendation for vegan protein when trying to work out build muscles trainers recommending protein shakes but smart Maria would prefer to avoid processed food can you imagine anything more process than protein powder it's like everything's been removed except the grunting and then of course they add also it's a crap in and hope I'll visit can begin on coming up to Toronto soon so anyway yeah what's the best way to get vegan protein I weigh beans right anyone doesn't know how to get protein on a plant-based diet doesn't know beans""), Document(metadata={'description': 'Nutritional quality indices show plant-based diets are the healthiest, but do vegetarians and vegans reach the recommended daily intake of

The largest study in history of those eating plant-based diets  recently compared the nutrient profiles  of about 30,000 non-vegetarians  to 20,000 vegetarians and about 5,000 vegans, flexitarians,  and no meat except fish-eaters,  allowing us to finally put to rest the perennial question,  ""Do vegetarians get enough protein?""  The average requirement is 42 grams of protein a day.  Non-vegetarians get way more than  they need, and so does everyone else.  On average, vegetarians and vegans get  70% more protein than they need every day. Surprising that there\'s so much fuss  about protein in this country  when less than 3% of adults don\'t make the cut,  presumably folks on extreme calorie-restricted  diets who just aren\'t eating enough food, period.  But 97% of Americans get enough protein.  There is a nutrient, though, for  which 97% of Americans are deficient.  Now that\'s a problem nutrient.  That\'s something we really have to work on.  Less than 3% of Americans get even the  recommended minimum adequate intake of... FIBER  So the question isn\'t  ""where do you get your protein?""  but ""where do you get your fiber?""  We only get about 15 grams a day.  The minimum daily requirement is 31.5  so we get less than half the minimum.  If you break it down by age and gender,  after studying the diets of 12,761 Americans,  the percent of men between ages 14 and 50  getting the minimum adequate intake? Zero. This deficit is stunning in that dietary  fiber has been protectively associated  with the risk of diabetes, metabolic syndrome,  cardiovascular disease, obesity,  and various cancers,  as well high cholesterol, blood  pressure, and blood sugars.  Therefore, it is not surprising  that fiber is now listed  as a nutrient of concern in the dietary  guidelines. Protein is not. One problem is that most people have  no idea what\'s in their food.  More than half of Americans think  steak is a significant fiber source.  By definition, fiber is only found in plants.  There is no fiber in meat, dairy or eggs,  and little or no fiber in junk food.  Therein lies the problem.  Americans should be eating more beans,  vegetables, fruits,  whole grains.  How are we doing on that?  Well, 96% of Americans don\'t eat the  recommended minimum daily intake of beans,  96% don\'t eat the measly minimum for greens,  99% don\'t get enough whole grains.  Look at these numbers.  Nearly the entire U.S. population fails  to eat enough whole plant foods.  And it\'s not getting better, a lack  of progress that\'s disappointing. Even semi-vegetarians, though,  make the minimum for fiber. And those eating completely plant-based  diets triple the average American intake.  Now when closing the fiber gap,  you\'ll want to do it gradually,  no more than about five extra  grams of fiber a day each week  until you can kind of work your way up. But it\'s worth it.  Plant-derived diets tend to contribute significantly  less fat, saturated fat, cholesterol,  and foodborne pathogens,  while at the same time offering more fiber,  folate, vitamin C, and phytochemicals,  all essential factors for disease prevention,  and optimal health and well being.  And the more plant foods, the better--  whole plant foods, the better. If you compare the nutritional quality  of vegan versus vegetarian,  semi-vegetarian, pesco-vegetarian  and omnivorous diets,  traditional healthy diet indexing systems,  like compliance with the dietary guidelines,  consistently indicate the most plant-based  diet as the most healthy one.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Nutritional quality indices show plant-based diets are the healthiest, but do vegetarians and vegans reach the recommended daily intake of protein?\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

But they weren\'t put to the test until the last century or so, purporting to show beyond a reasonable doubt that athletes who regularly ate meat showed very far inferior endurance to even sedentary vegetarians, meaning it\'s not like the veg athletes just won because they were training harder or something. There are certainly advantages to plant-based eating, like more antioxidants to combat exercise-induced oxidative stress, the anti-inflammatory nature of many plant foods that may accelerate muscle repair and strength recovery. But do you have to eat this way for years or decades or your whole life to get these apparent benefits? What if you took a couple guys in Texas, eating their regular Texan diet, put them through a maximal exercise test, then asked them to cut out the meat for four days? Told them about the existence of bean burritos, then after four days tested again, measuring time to exhaustion, ramping up the treadmill to see how many minutes could they go without collapsing? And there was a significant difference favoring the vegetarian diet, boosting the time to exhaustion by about 13 percent. Each of the subjects, all five, had a higher time to exhaustion following the vegetarian diet. But who can tell me the fatal flaw in this study? Anyone catch it? They were all in the same sequence: meat first then veg. And any time you do a test a second time, you may do better just because you\'re more familiar with it. If they then went back to eating meat and their performance tanked during the third test, then you might be onto something, but this isn\'t very convincing. And even if the effect is real, it may not be the meat reduction per se, but a function of improved glycogen stores from eating more carbs or something. If you put athletes to a vegetarian versus omnivorous diet for a 621-mile race—you\'ve heard of a 5k? This is a 1000k!— and you make sure to design the two diets so they get about the same percentage of carbs, the finishing  rates are identical, and total times within just a few hours of each other. Same thing with sprinting. Randomize people into veg or mixed diet groups, and no significant difference in sprint power between the two groups. They conclude that ""acute"" vegetarianism has no apparent adverse effects, but no apparent performance  benefits either. Same with strength training. Measure maximum voluntary contraction of both biceps and quads before and after each dietary period, and no significant difference either way. Put all the studies together comparing physical performance in these kinds of randomized, controlled trials, where you have folks eat more plant- based for just a few days or weeks and there appears to be no difference—at least acutely— between a vegetarian-based diet and an omnivorous diet in muscular power, muscular strength, or aerobic performance. Long-term, though, a plant- based diet can be conducive to both endurance performance and health. Whereas athletes are most often concerned with performance, more plant-based diets also provide long-term health benefits and a reduction in the risk of chronic disease, associated with a reduced risk of developing coronary heart disease— the number one killer of men and women— breast cancer, colorectal cancers, prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, hypertension, cataracts, and dementia.

What if you took a couple guys in Texas, eating their regular Texan diet, put them through a maximal exercise test, then asked them to cut out the meat for four days? Told them about the existence of bean burritos, then after four days tested again, measuring time to exhaustion, ramping up the treadmill to see how many minutes could they go without collapsing? And there was a significant difference favoring the vegetarian diet, boosting the time to exhaustion by about 13 percent. Each of the subjects, all five, had a higher time to exhaustion following the vegetarian diet. But who can tell me the fatal flaw in this study? Anyone catch it? They were all in the same sequence: meat first then veg. And any time you do a test a second time, you may do better just because you\'re more familiar with it. If they then went back to eating meat and their performance tanked during the third test, then you might be onto something, but this isn\'t very convincing. And even if the effect is real, it may not be the meat reduction per se, but a function of improved glycogen stores from eating more carbs or something. If you put athletes to a vegetarian versus omnivorous diet for a 621-mile race—you\'ve heard of a 5k? This is a 1000k!— and you make sure to design the two diets so they get about the same percentage of carbs, the finishing  rates are identical, and total times within just a few hours of each other. Same thing with sprinting. Randomize people into veg or mixed diet groups, and no significant difference in sprint power between the two groups. They conclude that ""acute"" vegetarianism has no apparent adverse effects, but no apparent performance  benefits either. Same with strength training. Measure maximum voluntary contraction of both biceps and quads before and after each dietary period, and no significant difference either way. Put all the studies together comparing physical performance in these kinds of randomized, controlled trials, where you have folks eat more plant- based for just a few days or weeks and there appears to be no difference—at least acutely— between a vegetarian-based diet and an omnivorous diet in muscular power, muscular strength, or aerobic performance. Long-term, though, a plant- based diet can be conducive to both endurance performance and health. Whereas athletes are most often concerned with performance, more plant-based diets also provide long-term health benefits and a reduction in the risk of chronic disease, associated with a reduced risk of developing coronary heart disease— the number one killer of men and women— breast cancer, colorectal cancers, prostate cancer, type 2 diabetes, insulin resistance, hypertension, cataracts, and dementia.

We don't need a diet; we need a new way of eating that we can comfortably stick with throughout our lives. If that's the case, then we better choose to eat in a way that will most healthfully sustain us. That's why a plant-based diet may offer the best of both worlds. It's the only diet shown to reverse heart disease, our number one killer, in the majority of patients. See for example Eliminating the #1 Cause of Death (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/eliminating-the-1-cause-of-death/).\n\nThere are a number of theories offered as to why those eating plant-based are so much slimmer on average.

So how\'s this for  a simple study— let\'s just analyze the  diets of 13,000 people and compare the nutrient  intake of those eating meat to the one of those eating  meat-free diets. They found that those  eating vegetarian were getting higher intakes  of nearly every nutrient, more fiber, more vitamin A,  more vitamin C, more vitamin E, more of the  B vitamins: thiamin, riboflavin, folate, more calcium, magnesium,  iron, and potassium, while at the same time eating  less of the harmful stuff like saturated fat and cholesterol. And yes, they got  enough protein. And some of those nutrients  are the ones Americans really struggle  to get enough of— fiber, vitamins A,C, and E,  calcium/magnesium/potassium and those eating vegetarian  got more of all of them. Even so, though, just because  they did better than the standard American diet  isn\'t saying much— they still didn\'t get as much  as they should have. I mean yes, those  eating vegetarian ate significantly more dark  green leafy vegetables, but that comes out to just  2 teaspoons of greens more. In terms of  weight management, the vegetarians were  consuming on average 363 fewer calories  every day. That\'s like what people do  when they go on a diet, and restrict their  food intake, but that seemed just like what  vegetarians ate normally, so a vegetarian diet  could be considered an all-you-care-to-eat version of a calorie-restricted  weight loss diet, naturally inducing  weight loss and also helping maintain healthy  weight status long term. So just following a  vegetarian diet alone, without focusing on calorie reduction, could result  in weight loss. How sustainable are more  plant-based diets long-term? They are in fact among  the ONLY type of diets that have been shown to  be sustainable long-term, perhaps because not only  do people lose weight but they often feel  so much better. And there\'s no calorie  counting or portion control. In fact, vegetarians may burn  more calories in their sleep! Those eating more  plant-based diets appear to have an 11% higher  resting metabolic rate. Both vegetarians and  vegans in this study just naturally seemed to have  a revved up metabolism compared to those  eating meat. Having said that, the vegetarian  diet pattern in this study included eating  eggs and dairy, so while they were  significantly slimmer than those  eating meat, they were still, on  average, overweight. As we\'ve seen before,  the only dietary pattern associated on average with  an IDEAL body weight was a strictly  plant-based one. Still, this study does  help dispel the myth that meat-free diets are  somehow nutrient deficient.

Michael Greger coming to you live from my treadmill as I do every month answer any questions you may have I'm already did my facebook live about an hour ago and so one more half hour this month you get any any and all of your questions answered I will try to get to as many of them as possible um the first one on the list is a row sexina asking is it possible to get too much exercise it is indeed possible to get to my exercise particularly if you're not used to exercising so you know you often you know I having worked in emergency room up in Boston you know we see people having heart attacks when they're shoveling snow they're basically sedentary the whole year all sudden they're exerting themselves they just don't have the the capacity their heart just doesn't have the capacity to take it but even you know endurance exercises you can certainly overdo it in terms of impairing your immune function I've got videos on that so you know people that even you know running marathon you know the put you at risk a higher risk offers respiratory tract infections after the marathon just because you've kind of you know your your body has to kind of has a certain amount of resources and if it puts it all towards you know running that marathon there's less left over to for upkeep of your immune system I've got lots of videos on what you can do in addition to you know wash your hands etc to reduce your risk of upper respiratory in fact in fact you can get back to 2 you can recover faster and get back to training reverse sexina also asks that says she has a weak immune system spite eating healthy any suggestions just type in immune why it's probably under immune function there's a facts that org and you'll get tons of videos popping up about all the various things you can do to improve your various aspects your immune function would actually have different we have an anti-cancer immunity women antiviral men day we have become first-line defense kind of stuff there's all sorts of things and there's a certainly role I can play also Street sleep and stress and also it's about a lifestyle approaches Kim T asked an iced tea cause kidney stones so I I mean so I'm a bunch of it isn't kidney stones mostly surrounding animal protein and sodium I'm cutting down on those reducing ones risk let me let me pubmed tea and kidney stones um oh here let me see if there's a meta-analysis here while we're at it tea tea um protective associations were found with increase intake of tea according to a meta-analysis of 15 studies with 350 1000 participants um so just right I it's not something I've run across in this meta-analysis which was published in 2015 it doesn't suggest such as the case but if you find out otherwise assembly the study maybe I'll do a video about it the vegan drummer asks in an already point based at what's the difference between buying the end of date sheep veg in comparison to fresh end of the day as opposed to like picked that morning um you eat your fruits and vegetables however you can get them obviously not if they're rotting or moldy but yes if buying cheap vegetables gets you to buy twice as many then that would be more important than getting one picked a few hours earlier Oh Olivier Hoch asked regarding viagra in cancer video which I believe was yesterday's video fish eaters have 7th have 7th 1/7 presumably of the sperm concentration of non fish eaters however couldn't be the cases due to a higher load ah got it um so that was the case with soy consumption if you remember I did a video but there was concern of lower sperm counts among people that eat soy but the sperm count is a concentration number of sperm per milliliter and turns out that the ejaculates of men that eat soy is so much larger that it's just a dilution effect I've actually if you look at the absolute number of sperm it's the same I mean it was just it was just diluted and larger jocular so um could that be the case for fish eaters uh I would presume no just because 7 times ma is a a certainly in the in the soy case yeah it was a matter of I forget what it was but it wasn't they it wasn't seven hundred percent difference but anytime you look at sperm count it's important to take that into account I certainly agree Olivier is back asking purchased coca leaf for a little boost do I know anything about coca leaves regarding health impacts I'm instead of instead of consuming cocaine we can go for the whole foods Varian coca leaves have been chewed for centuries without evidence of addiction I'm in terms of what are the health consequences on that is something that I don't think it's been studied well and it'd have to be something I would have to look into but in terms of addiction potential just because I ran across that looking at my marijuana research that that it's not something we're worried about but is it good for you that's another question on that question I don't know the answer to Niels Arnie Holt asks friend has faced Aging pimples gaps on his cheeks not sure what gaps means some vague non-west have some vague non-western doctor suggested fructose and I'm surprised of the hospital it was confirmed now he avoids fruit thoughts okay fructose intolerance we all are fructose intolerant to a certain degree that what that means is the ability to absorb our bill to absorb fructose in our small intestine is limited I mean can lead to basically osmotic diarrhea but I shouldn't have anything to do with face itching or pimples and and and it's not the amount of fructose you'd ever get in fruit I mean we're talking about you know those loads in you know from harvest corn syrup or table sugar sucrose when we eat largely soda is where we can get such a high load that we can actually get some we actually get such a high fructose load but yeah so staying away from fruit I would not expect it to help with pimples in fact you know according the global burden of disease study larger study and human respecters to date funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation the number one dietary risk factor for death in the world what is it is it soda processed meat junk food no it's inadequate fruit consumption number one dietary cause of death eats your fruit Olivier's back as I hope you pump it's either do I still need to brush my teeth yes I didn't even finish the question and I'm already answering many animals have great teeth without brushing I'm doing each sperm I only rinse with green tea if I eat nothing bad that day um so okay sorry to make light of that question there actually was a study oh um trying to see in what context that study may be well anyway they did this this is dressing say it was a like a reality TV show where they make people eat like go paleo for a month and buy go paleo like literally like no toothbrush no nothing and so living off the land and so they had no junk food by definition although actually they had they were given honey and they and so of course plaque buildup on their teeth but they actually didn't develop gingivitis which is really interesting I mean the reason we care about plaque buildup is because that causes gingivitis gum inflammation and gum inflammation can cause periodontal disease which is inflammation in the structures that hold on to her teeth that can lead to tooth loss and that can have all sorts of negative effects um but what was interesting is they got all this plaque on their teeth but their gums look perfectly fine and the thought was because they're eating all these anti-inflammatory plant foods are you just eating massive tons of berries and everything and suggesting that if one ate a healthy enough diet the one might not run the same problems but how about eat a healthy diet and brush your teeth just to cover all bases that would be my suggestion but yeah that actually was very interesting sighting was really surprising it's in one video coming up I'm not exactly sure what context how long my Cicely asks how much fat is too much on a vegan diet it's not the amount of fat it is the source of fat same thing with protein Samson's carbohydrates almost same thing protein you actually can OD on protein but it's the source so fat from one that's great but and so even you know lots of one that's great but even a little bit of you know trans fats per se addressing oils would be too much because we should ideally none and same thing with you know saturated fats and cholesterol ideal intake is zero so you can as long as you're eating whole plant foods that's the most important thing as far as I'm concerned so you could eat a high fat whole food plant-based diet with nuts seeds avocados or even low fat of a pump based diet you should benefit either way Neil's knee jolt asked us a source of protein powder for muscle gain matter it or is the need for protein nonsense even for amateur bodybuilders um so I would not recommend protein powders for any reason um but we should get protein I mean it's like I mean we have like a carbohydrate powder would be like corn starch or table sugar or like a fat powder would just be uh now a block of lard or something like that's not how begin you choose for your nutrients from food right and so we should get our protein bathing you know legumes please flip these chickpeas and lentils you look you can mash beans and oatmeal you put beans in the spirit put lentils put lentil sprouts in a smoothie not protein powder why would you do that you're missing out all the other nutrients you'd get in those nice whole house and clam foods it's not like anyone's most people are deficient in protein unless of course you're on some extremely low calorie diet not eating the food then you have to be careful about getting all essential nutrients but does the source of protein powder matter yes it does and so in terms of maximal gain but you know it's interesting when you look at those studies most of them are lean talk about lean body mass but lean body mass is not muscle people make that""), Document(metadata={'description': 'Every month I go live from my treadmill to answer your questions here on YouTube and on Facebook.

recommend colloidal silver in fact you can become silver poisoned by ingesting some people put it up their nose and you should not use silver internally you can get actually get a disease turns your skin strange color now is there a role for chloride or silver in topical applications outside the body perhaps in some rare circumstances of multi drug-resistant bacteria but that is not something that people should be using willy-nilly and certainly not internally I can't pronounce I'm so sorry I can't pronounce some of these names Joaquin so uh where'd you go okay stinky boom boom let's thank you boom boom asks I don't place a weird sticky boob no go I need to increase my the size of my chat window here okay I was so close to stinky boom-boom okay then it just disappeared I'm so sorry Ms boom-boom or mr. boom-boom okay I'm sorry I gotta go back to the bottom because it's growing up so quickly okay umm any story about BP and vegan Omar asks any story about BP blood pressure and a vegan diet absolutely I have a whole chapter on blood pressure in the book we've known since the nineteen twenties that high blood pressure need not occur my researchers measured the blood pressures at a thousand people living in rural Kenya published in The Lancet right of the most prestigious medical journal in the world 1929 and our blood pressures go up at we as we ate sets up a sixty the majority of us are hypertensive where is their eating a diet centered around fruits vegetables wild dark green leafy vegetables including and beans they're both pressures actually go down as they age in fact down to the ideal blood pressure so there's no benefit from reducing further blood pressure of 110 over 70 that's where we should all be working on and they got there naturally just eating healthy I miss anything with rural China 110 over 70 their entire lives 70 year old same average book pressures 16 year old and again what was you know what's the Venn diagram of the rural African nation diets it was plant-based that they need only not special occasions why do we things the plant-based nature their debts it was some protective because in the Western world according the American Heart Association the only folks getting it down that low are those eating strictly plant-based diets coming in average 110 over 65 so the to answer your question BP and vegan diets average 110 over 65 perfect ideal blood pressures so that's the nine people to go on and treat the cause if however you are on blood pressure medication you need to do this with supervision of your physician because they need to wrap it they may need to rapidly wean you off these blood pressure medications because you can't be on blood pressure man if you treat the call as eliminating our blood pressure can't be on blood pressure pills with normal blood pressure you drop your pressures too low you get dizzy fall over can hurt yourself so ironically the side effects are not having to take drugs or having to take fewer drugs so please work with your physician closely to wean yourself off these medications everything getting off completely and then not suffer the side effect and more importantly treat the cause of the disease okay any research on recovery for vegan athletes asked Ricky Kay with lots of question marks yeah I got a bunch of videos coming up on on on plant-based athletes and indeed that seems to be the key as the recovery time just because the anti-inflammatory nature of the diet it just allows people to to train that much harder but of course the secret is in the training not the diet the die just helps you enables you to train more but you still have to actually do the training no magic bullet all right Michael Stigall Stiggy Stigall SRU of course I'm to turn a treadmill on my walk about 17 miles a day of course tomorrow I'm gonna be in a plane on my butt all day but when I'm home if two of my diet roll of my life yes I'm on a treadmill day I'm working a treadmill desk I can you're a mound not tip to the camera down you'll see my well I don't know if you'll see then um that's my I got my keyboard I got my I got everything there um so yeah so then I can get work done does that actually show okay all right I knew I should have put pants on and yeah I'm treadmill because said being sedentary is not good for you even if you exercise even if you are you know go to the gym after work sitting down for six hours or more a day associated with living a significantly shorter lifespan I've got some videos about that check it out what is my input on the lemon first thing in the morning fine with me um I would just rinse your mouth out with water after eating that lemon or any citrus or any sour food so is not to a road your dental enamel okay Evan asks oh darn it Evan asked okay I'm not scroll up see if I'm ketchup yes should we limit soy intake I encouraged I think the sweet spot was three to five servings a day if I remember my own videos correctly because that high at two over five servings a day you can increase your levels of igf-1 insulin-like growth factor moments a cancer promoter growth hormone associated with animal protein consumption but enough soy protein you can get higher idea for on levels to which is not a good thing Elizabeth asks should humans fast that is a fantastic question there's a rich literature now I wanted to do fasting videos but there was just no science out there but now there's just been this burst of science and Clark restriction into meeting intermittent fasting water only fasting and also it's a really cool data and I can't wait to dig through and do a whole series of videos I hear you and the videos are coming subscribe at nutrition facts the bargain you will be the first to know when the first fasting video goes up alright how chloe Parker asks how do I feel about the work of ring Crowe nice I think Ray is a genius brilliant guy we share a lot of research anytime I come across a really interesting paper that I think would be helped it's work I send it to him he returns the favor he's got a book he's working a book called I think our broken plates something like that and I'm so excited for its release he's already published in the peer-reviewed medical Aries a former NASA engineer smart guy kind of reminds me of Pritikin right someone out of medical background just an engineering background and just wants to know the facts just show me the data and he's done a deep dive in the nutrition of literature and really has some fascinating stuff and I've done one video I think about his work I got a bunch more videos coming out about his work hey simple question as short films ABC macros what percentage the question is like should like 80/10/10 or what's the percentage of macronutrients from protein carbs and fat and the answer is it's the source that matters is dr. David Katz likes to say carbohydrates are lentils and lollipops so you can't say should eat more or less carbohydrates because what does that mean same thing with fat fat is lard if that is walnuts when the healthiest foods right you have talked about sources longer sources whole plant foods um I'm more interested with eating whole plant foods would then whether or not you're eating high or low fat or but you know so so as long as they're whole food source of fat and I talking about a while talking about and nuts seeds avocados those are health promoting foods I encourage people to eat up palmful actually uh nuts every day that's actually one of my daily doesn't another one is the tablespoon of ground flax seeds and so it's not it's fat good or bad it's the source whole food sources of fat carbs and protein or your best bet is okay t5 carrots a day ask Jackie it is okay to eat five carrots a day and even better dip those carrots and some bean dip or hummus or and time that you're making me hungry okay how can chem 2020s can your blood type dictate your eating habits I've got videos about the blood type diet or blood type astrology but that to me it seems the same as asking does my just my horoscope have anything to do with what I should eat and so the scientific community has been rightly very skeptical of that work and sees it more as a marketing gimmick than having any supportive at science um Maggie asked how can you increase your fertility actually very similar for both men and women it's eating a healthy plant-based diet though there was a the the Adventists too just had a sperm count diet that found I think that sperm counts of vegans was lower I have that that study doing everybody get just noted the the title abstract and I will do a video about it but in general I've got videos on fertility and low in saturated fat intake Siva soon someone in the plant-based would have improved fertility I will check out the study and letting you know what about a healthy vegan weight gain for strengthening athletes s Loukas so healthy if you add the word healthy in there then we're talking about whole plant foods um you know for athletes that are spending a lot of energy particularly swimmers they're just losing so much humanity EFT you know even thousands of extra calories a day you know that can be challenging on a plant-based diet because their foods are relatively clerkly dilute I mean you have to huge amounts of food now for most people that's a good thing it's hard just hard to get in excess of calories on a plant-based diet so great for weight loss but if you're actually trying to maintain a kind of endurance athlete my lifestyle where you know you're doing you know four or five thousand calories a day the way to do that is eat more eat more frequently even more calorically dense so we're talking nuts nut butters avocados smoothies you can kind of sneak liquid calories past your body and kind of fool the body a little bit so you know dried""), Document(metadata={'description': ""The myth that plant proteins are incomplete, necessitating protein combining, was debunked by the scientific nutrition community decades ago.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Vitamin D, the ""sunshine vitamin,"" is created when skin is exposed to sunlight. Everything else comes from the ground. Minerals originate from the earth, and vitamins from the plants and micro-organisms that grow from it. The calcium in a cow\'s milk (and her 200-pound skeleton) came from all the plants she ate, which drew it up from the soil. We can cut out the middle-moo, though, and get calcium from the plants directly. Where do you get your protein? Protein contains essential amino acids, meaning our bodies can\'t make them and so are essential to get from our diet. But other animals don\'t make them either. All essential amino acids originate from plants (and microbes), and all plant proteins have all essential amino acids. The only truly ""incomplete"" protein in the food supply is gelatin, which is missing the amino acid tryptophan. So the only protein source that you couldn\'t live on is Jell-O. As I covered previously, those eating plant-based diets average about twice the average daily requirement for protein. Those who don\'t know where to get protein on a plant-based diet don\'t know beans! Get it? That\'s protein quantity, though. What about protein quality? The concept that plant protein was inferior to animal protein arose from studies performed on rodents more than a century ago. Scientists found that infant rats don\'t grow as well on plants. But infant rats don\'t grow as well on human breast milk either, so does that mean we shouldn\'t breastfeed our babies? Ridiculous! They\'re rats. Rat milk has ten times more protein than human milk, because rats grow about ten times faster than human infants. It\'s true that some plant proteins are relatively low in certain essential amino acids. So about 40 years ago, the myth of ""protein combining"" came into vogue— literally: the February \'75 issue of Vogue magazine. The concept was that we needed to eat ""complementary proteins"" together, for example rice and beans, to make up for their relative shortfalls. This fallacy was refuted decades ago, the myth that plant proteins are incomplete, that plant proteins aren\'t as good, that one has to combine proteins at meals. These have all been dismissed by the nutrition community as myths decades ago, but many in medicine evidently didn\'t get the memo. Dr. John McDougall called out the American Heart Association for a 2001 publication that questioned the completeness of plant proteins. Thankfully though they\'ve changed and acknowledged now that plant proteins can provide all the essential amino acids; no need to combine complementary proteins. It turns out our body is not stupid. It maintains pools of free amino acids that can be used to do all the complementing for us, not to mention the massive protein recycling program our body has. Some 90 grams of protein is dumped into the digestive tract every day from our own body to get broken back down and reassembled, so our body can mix and match amino acids to whatever proportions we need, whatever we eat, making it practically impossible to even design a diet of whole plant foods that\'s sufficient in calories, but deficient in protein. Thus, plant-based consumers do not need to be AT ALL concerned about amino acid imbalances from the plant proteins that make up our usual diets.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Why might we want low levels of IGF-1 in adulthood? See IGF-1 is a One Stop Cancer Shop (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/igf-1-as-one-stop-cancer-shop/). As we saw in How Plant-Based to Lower IGF-1? (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/how-plant-based-to-lower-igf-1/), vegan men have higher testosterone levels, which can be a risk factor for prostate cancer and enlargement, but given the average IGF-1 levels of those eating plant-based diets this may not be an issue. See Ex Vivo Cancer Proliferation Bioassay (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/developing-an-ex-vivo-cancer-proliferation-bioassay/) and Prostate vs. a Plant-Based Diet (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/prostate-versus-a-plant-based-diet/). Having said that, if they eat excess ""high quality"" protein, they may not retain their IGF-1 advantage. See Higher Quality May Mean Higher Risk (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/higher-quality-may-mean-higher-risk/), Animalistic Plant Proteins (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/animalistic-plant-proteins/), Too Much Soy May Neutralize Benefits (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/too-much-soy-may-neutralize-plant-based-benefits/), and How Much Soy Is Too Much?

But in some circumstances, a little extra growth is sought after, particularly for men in this culture — though not exclusively. The growth hormone IGF-1 is the reason some dogs look like this, and others like this. What about those who strive to be the big dog? Yes, lower circulating levels of IGF-1 in vegans lowers cancer risk, but might that interfere with their accumulation of muscle mass? There certainly are lots of plant-based body builders, but maybe they’re the exception. To look like this, does one have to risk looking like this? True or false: Lower IGF-1 levels in vegans likely interferes with muscle accumulation. Is this fact, or is this fiction? Well, there’s a couple ways you attack that question. For example, what’s the skeletal muscle mass like in acromegaly? People afflicted with giantism — where they have an IGF overload in the body. If IGF bulks up muscle, you’d think they’d be musclebound; but no, they don’t have any more muscle, on average, than anyone else. What if you inject people with IGF-1? They injected women for a year, and found no increase in lean body mass or grip, bench or leg press strength. What about men? Basically, same thing. They had about a dozen 22-year-olds flex for 15 weeks under different hormonal milieus, and concluded that elevations in ostensibly anabolic hormones, like IGF-1, with resistance exercise, enhances neither training-induced muscle bulk, nor strength. ""Thus it seems that outside of [genetically engineered mice or a cell culture dish or other animal models] that the search for the true role of the growth potential for IGF-1 in adult muscle hypertrophy is a vain one."" So, although it’s never been directly tested, probably fiction.')]","For someone who has just started weight training and is looking for high-protein vegetarian meals to help build muscle, there are several nutritious options that can support muscle growth and recovery. Here are some meal ideas that are both high in protein and suitable for a vegetarian diet:

1. **Chickpea and Spinach Curry**: Chickpeas are a great source of protein and carbohydrates. Cook them in a tomato-based sauce with spinach, garlic, onions, and a blend of spices like turmeric, cumin, and coriander. Serve with brown rice or whole-wheat naan for added protein and fiber.

2. **Quinoa and Black Bean Salad**: Quinoa is a complete protein, meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids. Mix cooked quinoa with black beans, diced bell peppers, corn, cilantro, and a lime vinaigrette for a refreshing and protein-rich meal.

3. **Tofu Stir-Fry**: Tofu is an excellent source of protein for vegetarians. Stir-fry firm tofu with a variety of colorful vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, bell peppers, and snap peas. Use soy sauce, ginger, and garlic for flavoring. Serve over a bed of brown rice or quinoa.

4. **Lentil Soup**: Lentils are very high in protein and perfect for building muscle. Make a hearty lentil soup with vegetables like carrots, tomatoes, celery, and spinach. Add herbs and spices to enhance the flavor. This meal is not only high in protein but also rich in fiber and iron.

5. **Greek Yogurt with Nuts and Berries**: For a quick and easy high-protein snack or breakfast, mix Greek yogurt with a handful of nuts (such as almonds or walnuts) and fresh berries. Greek yogurt is much higher in protein than regular yogurt and can be a great part of a muscle-building diet.

6. **Vegetarian Chili**: Use a variety of beans like kidney beans, black beans, and pinto beans along with lentils, diced tomatoes, bell peppers, and corn. Season with chili powder, cumin, and garlic. Beans and lentils provide a solid protein boost.

7. **Egg Omelette with Vegetables**: Eggs are a complete source of protein. Make an omelette and fill it with vegetables such as spinach, mushrooms, and tomatoes. Add some cheese for extra protein and flavor.

8. **Paneer Tikka**: Paneer is an Indian cheese that is high in protein. Marinate paneer cubes in yogurt and spices, then grill or bake them until golden brown. Serve with salad or vegetables for a balanced meal.

These meals not only provide the necessary protein for muscle growth but also offer a variety of other nutrients essential for overall health and fitness. Remember to complement your diet with regular strength training and adequate hydration to effectively build muscle.","For someone who has just started weight training and is looking for high-protein vegetarian meals to help build muscle, there are several nutritious options that can support muscle growth and recovery.

Michael Greger coming to you live from my treadmill like I do every month to answer any questions you may have this year I'm excited to answer your question in person in book signing lines in Q&A is 200 cities lined up although I've only got like 190 to go or something been on the road for a couple of weeks in Southern California in Arizona but hopefully we'll be in your town soon including countries like Poland and Denmark and Iceland for the first time ever I'm really excited in Denmark is crazy they had to open a whole bed like an 800 person theater they had to do a second thing because they sold out so quickly they're doing a whole second showing I guess I'm gonna do two back-to-back that is just so coolest place I've ever even been so I just I think speaks to the tremendous surge in interest in healthy eating so that's super exciting so that's the best part is seeing everybody of course all the travel and bad food and bad sleep is not the best part but I'll be done 10 months and off to write the next book how not to age anyway for those who are unfamiliar to every year I redo every issue of every English ladies nutrition journal the world so busy folks like you don't have to I think upon combined all the most interesting most groundbreaking most practical families and the new videos and articles upload every day nearly every day to my number I would say nutritionfacts.org everything on the website is what free there are no ads no corporate sponsorship strictly non-commercial not saw anything just put it up as a public service as a labor of love as a tribute to my grandmother new videos an article said free day nearly every day and latest an evidence-based nutrition what a concept alright let's start with your questions what's so nice about Facebook log as opposed to YouTube no YouTube I supposed to Facebook live is the questions don't move like you're putting your questions down and I just go in order I don't have to skip it and cuz it scroll up too quickly but um so let's do it number one Steve Parker why eliminate nutritional yeast I'm sorry if you've got that impression so on Facebook someone with hid retinitis support Eva says what should I cut out of my diet I said nutrition 'is there are two groups of individuals that should not eat nutritional yeast well three I guess one if you have an allergy which I've never heard of but on to is if you have had United subroutine v''e which is autoimmune condition as well as Crohn's disease why I've got videos on that just type in nutritionist and check it all out but for everybody else just say is perfectly fine and I had some for breakfast actually all right Carl Carl yeah Carl Cramer says any advice for loose skin and post big weight loss first of all congratulations on the big weight loss you will off so much weight you have loose skin that is a phenomenal feat keep up the good work but unfortunately the only thing new there are only surgical interventions in terms of cosmetic surgery to get rid of the excess flaps of skin and for everybody else not gain that much weight in the first place my synergy dance Dan CO or synergy dance acts how are the majority of longest-living people in blue zones doing so well despite eating meat fish dairy occasionally you just answered your own question because they only eat meat fish dairy occasionally so for example the Okinawan Japanese the second longest living population in the world of course this is when they weren't eating KFC like they are now they actually have some of the worst public health statistics now but in the 50s when they're reading how their more traditional diets they had like a 97% plant-based diet and so and really have that kind of a sweet potato vegetable based diet um the only people live longer than them only formerly study population is the seven day Adventists vegetarians Loma Linda California I just spoken love Linda that was a lot of fun and and they don't eat any meat at all and they're the only blue zone that actually like continues to be a blue zone right now these other these are historical examples they now westernized their diet so but the blue zone that is doing the best and continues to thrive is the one that doesn't eat any meat at all and living about a decade longer and general population Richard Strauss says what's the optimal dose is your vitamin E per day well dosage implies you're taking vitamin supplement want to do actually there's a study suggesting that those taking vitamin E supplements actually cut their lives short but you do need vitamin E but you should get it from natural sources like that's in seeds um why do Oh possible possibly right says why do we avoid mr. Solis I didn't say that I only said if you have Crohn's disease and or hidradenitis suppurativa everybody else feel free to eat your nutrition yeast in fact it's a way to get your vitamin b12 if it's fortified with b12 oh speaking of b12 ApS is duckweed a safe plant source for b12 and the answer is not until it's proven to be right I mean that's critically important all right vitamin b12 so the company that makes it or that packaged it that sells it purports on to show active b12 that is improvement until people with b12 deficiency are a given duckweed is a sole source and their b12 level recovers right there home assistant comes down if they're fully replete or they're methylmalonic acid level drops it's the only way right um so there's a lot of tests for b12 that don't necessarily show active b12 there are b12 analogs cause your body can't use fools our body actually they're like connect as anti b12 so you just do not want to mess around you can end up paralyzed demented or dead from a b12 deficiency so until it's proven to be a reliable source where they actually do a clinical study you could it's easy to find vegans low in b12 right because so many vegans are too stupid to not to to not supplement they are stupid for not supplementing and um so you put pretend of them twenty of them and give them some duckweed and see what happens and until then it's not a reliable source of b12 until it's proven to be a reliable source of b12 because it's not something you want to mess around with all right critically important all right and look even if they claimed that there's a bacteria that kind of lives in the duckweed that produce would be 12 let's say they do the study and they show that a batch of duckweed improves their their veto status okay that's great so you can you say that that batch of duckweed improves to be 12 it doesn't mean all duckweed or all the duckweed they even sell has active b12 maybe it has different bacteria that aren't making b12 at the moment so unless they can show reliably that whatever species of duckweed they have just always makes b12 that's always usable by people if that's not the case then you need to stick with supplements a vitamin b12 or vitamin b12 fortified foods okay Emily Paige Peron or posh a Peron says hi what you take on gluten flour homemade note well no salt say 1000 obviously so not a whole food but it's a green yellow or green light food um so it's a yellow light food it's the process plant food so it's a platform from which something bad good has been taken away or something bad has been added and here's this case nothing bad has been added but there has been something good taken away right you you know how to make seitan you wash away the fiber wash away some nutrition but but in terms of meat substitutes certainly better then you know everything else in the market right which has added sodium often added saturated fat of course what would be even better meets us to real whole food like legumes whole grains mushrooms these kind of things okay anyway tattooed woman asked please talk about nano volley pig in assists and how hard it is for the Oh for the body it turned carbohydrate into fat so tattooed women did not mean men denovo leap in Genesis she meant that de novo epigenesis so your body so it's true that if you over feed people calories it's easier to make people gain weight giving people fat calories in carbohydrate calories in fact you can make 100,000 College disappear by effective feeding people trying to over feed people carbohydrates opposed to fat I talked about this study but in long Vermont prisoners where they tried this experimental weight gain say they tried to get people to gain weight took one hundred thousand more calories on a mixed diet then then all fat died but but the problem it so but if you like you drink all ones if you drink a couple liters of soda a day even though you won't make a lot of fat you know where that fat is made that fat is made in your liver increases liver fat which is can dull the sensitivity to insulin in your liver and set you up for all sorts of badness so so yeah do not overeat my added sugars so yeah okay so even if it doesn't you're like oh it just puts a few grams of fat on your body huh yeah because where it is liver fat that's a bad thing increase your risk of fat liver disease again bad thing okay the chosen comment asks someone working in hospitals working for on for office it possible is it difficult to it is difficult to intermittent task I'm not eating the middle of night any recommendations I don't eat the middle of the night I mean that's there's not much you can do I mean there's all sorts of clonal biological badness that comes along with night shifts I'm like the light in the middle of the night that's not good but you can't do much about that but you can do something about eating so you don't eat it you still don't either die on you eat before you go to before you go to bed and in the morning or before you go to - - to work and in terms of well I'm gonna get so hungry going on that without food well you need to you know eat your thylakoids you

Michael Greger live from my treadmill here to answer any and all questions you may have I did a facebook live earlier today and doing YouTube now will do this every month for those who come from others my work every year I read through every issue of every English language nutrition journal in the world some busy folks like you don't have to I think follow most interesting most groundbreaking most practical findings into new videos novels upload everyday to my website nutritionfacts.org everything on the website is free there are no ads no commercial uh no corporate sponsorship strictly non-commercial not selling anything just put it up as a public service as a labor of love as a tribute to my grandmother who is the reason that I went into medicine and practice lifestyle medicine to this day let me start at the top and I will go through the questions and hopefully get to yours Paulo a so many health concerns associated with drinking water from plastic bottles I guess there are if you look at there are both microbiological concerns as well as chemical concerns so for example from polycarbonate plastic if you search on nutrition of Exxon org for the word for the letters BPA my you will see my videos about some of these plastics chemicals also on phthalates start spelled with a P P th ala tes my check out those or just type in plastics or plastic into nutrition facts that are a little search bar all my videos will come up um and you can enjoy lance ass how do I prevent water intoxication if I don't salt my foods um if um so hyponatremia is you can actually wash out the electrolytes in your system if you um exercise intensely sweat a lot and or just drinking pure water the concern was that wait a second don't have to add salt to my food as if for millions of years of evolution we had salt shakers sitting there um no need to add salt food um but we should but if you are excessively exercising you need to replete your electrolytes that's the whole kind of gatorade thing you can do it a lot healthier than just drinking sugar water by eating actual food like fruit um and so we should get all our sodium from natural sources not from salsa come not from processed foods you do not have to take a bag of potato chips on your bike rides ah seabird asks I am requesting an option to see Spanish subtitles absolutely in fact we have Spanish subtitles on hundreds of videos people don't realize that if you do a search for videos on nutrition of X or um there's language options you can say I just want to see the ones with Polish subtitles or Russian subtitles or you know the Italian subtitles amen Spanish is actually our most common one we've got hundreds of videos already translated we have a whole team of translation volunteers you actually can be one of those if you'd like to help out we're actually going to convert the entire site into Spanish so not just the subtitles for all the videos but like all the wording on the site so it would be like a little flag you know you go to some websites and it's like you can choose your language um well it's going to be same thing nutrition facts outdoor where you can see in English when you see the entire site in Spanish um and then we're going to move to other languages to broaden the number of people that can have access to this life-changing life-saving information but right now you can access those Spanish subtitles by just doing a search on nutrition facts at work and then clicking the spanish-language buttons all right Laura asked coumadin I've been diagnosed ah with a thrombus a clot warfare every day to maintain a 9r they're vegetarians does guarantee bristled without anticoagulants absolutely not you need anti if you have excessively clotting blood for whatever reason or if you have a heart valve or any kind of internal hardware that could cause your blood to clot although there is there are there's basically what's called salicylic acid which is kind of the active ingredient in aspirin found in plant foods not just in willow bark or as originally harvested from UM and so people eating plant-based diets particularly the spicy plant-based that's just a lot of salicylates in spices like cumin ma you will have blood levels of aspirin on which rival that of people actually taking a baby aspirin a small dose aspirin pill every day even though you're not on aspirin you have the same aspirin doses of your body that may actually been be beneficial in terms of reducing not only heart disease risk a stroke risk certain types of stroke risk as well as cancer risk and I've got a bunch of videos coming up on aspirin and cancer but that's not your blood would not be thin enough to prevent clots if you have some excessive clotting disorder and so if your physician wants you on coumadin then you need to to remain on coumadin as long and just make sure that you they titrate the greens consumption you dark green leafy vegetable consumption the mountain community does basically cumin is a vitamin k poison and so on if you eat a lot of vitamin K you need up your dose to keep them in line alright okay Lance okay um Lance is just making some comments that's good okay I'm gonna keep going down um um I don't know how to pronounce a Jo a with a little thing on it Oh I'm sorry I said he has an exam with 289 people on grams per milliliter of b12 as at a healthy level ma you assuming those the units I'm familiar with um yes that would be fine but you still would want to take the question is should continue to take vitamin b12 of course you should a 2500 microns once a week of cyanic of elements probably all you or anyone should need I mean you say well wait a second more fine levels are fine well they won't be fine for long if you don't get a regular reliable source of vitamin b12 um Sarah read an article from a nutrigenomics company saying that your genes determine whether or not animal or plant base to make 3s are good for you all mega 3s are originally plant-based and are then created by animals such as yourselves when you eat them there may be polymorphisms but which means kind of gene variations in mod Delta 60 saturates enzymes the elongation enzymes but and so one may want to take a preformed long-chain omega-3 fatty acid supplement I've got a bunch of videos new videos about that so check it out a vitamin Lindsay says what do I think about intermittent fasting I've got a bunch of videos on intermittent fasting coming up I keep saying that but I do and it's actually a really complex topic um and but I will be talking about all the variations of intermittent fast and water-only fasting the timing duration meals all sorts of good stuff it's all coming out um it's not that I'm trying to keep anything from you I just haven't read all the science yet there's tremendous load hundreds of new articles um and so I want to make sure I have a sense of where they're going just doing kind of a light reading but I wanted to a deep dive before I before I synthesize all the available science alright Michael good name s if you take a DHA EPA supplement how much ala should get every day as it's still important to keep in to make a six to make a three ratio 4 to 1 um so um if you're already getting prima so the reason one wants to keep their ratio relatively low makes 16 mega threes is to kind of facilitate your body's elongation stretching omega-3s found in flax seeds and walnuts not into the long-chain versions um but also G still need to do that if you're taking um you know and and you need to get a source of of of ala like flex seeds or walnuts or hemp nuts or chia seeds if you're already taking that and my answer is yes to both but not for the reason one might think so I mean what's the recommendation to about make six ratio it stay away from junky vegetables like Cornell safflower oil sunflower oil concealed oil so you'd still want to do that regardless for all sorts of reasons and why so do you not have to take flax seeds now if you're getting a preformed source of of DHA will make you three something only reason we eat a super healthy foods like black seeds and walnuts they have other health problem in compounds for example flax seeds have these anti-cancer lignin compounds which you know you would be missing out on so it's still stick with my daily doesn't recommend actually get a tablespoon of ground flax seeds every day for the other health benefits priscila talked about BPA at the beginning ah ma soeur know are there plant foods that reverse postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and small fiber neuropathy um I do not know of any um but if you do a PubMed search so if you go PubMed gov govt um that's the database National Library of Medicine or just medical library in the world and you type in whatever grow that you're interested in and the word diet or foods or such and Stace come up um I'd be have it look at them send them my way I will dig them up and if there's something interesting useful for others I will make a video about it and share with others alright Steve what foods would I recommend for a toddler to have on a daily basis Oh like a daily dozen toddler version that's a good idea I should come up with that um until I do though I would encourage you to check out wonderful sources like anything Brenda Davis is written or read mangles has written they both done wonderful books and chapters on feeding healthy diets to infants and small children um Cristina named assessing research on diet macular degeneration very certain there is I just haven't looked at it yet I haven't got to my latest I folder um studies I could actually look at it now but it would take some time but if there is I realize that's an issue that a lot of people deal with and we'll definitely do any videos on any new exciting developments in that area David asks what foods increased stamina and energy I need more than a caffeine jolt um well um the question is I mean you should

Michael Greger coming to you live from my treadmill like I do every month answer your questions on both Facebook live and here on YouTube I just finished my facebook an hour ago and here for my last Q&A of the month so get your questions in now I see some people are already listed them down I will start at the top and just go straight down and hopefully get to your question those young familiar is my work every year I read through every issue of every English language nutrition journal in the world's all busy folks like you don't have to I think about the most interesting most groundbreaking less practical finds new videos and articles uploaded everyday to my non-profit site nutritionfacts.org everything the website is free there are no ads no corporate sponsorships really non-commercial not selling anything just put up as a public service as a labor of love as a tribute to my grandmother whose own life was saved with evidence-based nutrition let us get to your questions Jessica asks thank you for my work what about BPA in an air popper for popcorn I don't want to undo the benefits of popcorn by adding BPA so BPA is a plastics compound used as a liner for can't from any canned goods and in polycarbonate plastics so it's something like you know leaving a hot water bottle in a car or something you get BP on your water but I don't know how an air popper would put BPA so BPA is used for flexible plastics in fact that's why they add it to plastics and so an air pop person I made it out of flexible plastic I'm not sure where I I can't imagine how an air popper would have put BPA on your popcorn so I wouldn't worry about it unless you have data otherwise let me know and I'll maybe do a video about it Leanne says questions asked now will almost certain not be here by the time dr. Greger shows up in two hours so I suggest trying bad well Liana dears you're wrong so it looks like two hours before my next Q&A and all my Q&A is here in YouTube you can already start listing your questions you could have your question first like Jessica did and get it answered okay well it's good to know so thank you for the end for for helping us out okay um Leanne oh the N is answering someone called be mindful saying that she thinks prune juice would be yellow light since there's a process plant food oh so well so there's one so actually so tomato juice it's actually healthier than tomatoes within less of their salt added but so yeah so I mean obviously it is the way I defined process is nothing but added nothing good removed um and so is so no salt added tomato juice enzyme anything bad editing saying well yeah but you remove the fiber actually tomato just has a lot of fiber well you they don't seem to remove a lot of the fiber and the cooking process that makes the major section makes mods a beta carotene and lycopene some of these cotton are you find an intersection more absorbable so I would put tomato juice an agreement that sulfur each manager sent greenlight category in terms of prune juice that's a good question I wonder because prune juice things to become a thick is there fiber maybe they remove some of the fiber so yeah probably prunes or plums would be healthier than eating fruit juice but it I I don't think prune juice is like something like apple juice where they literally like remove all the fiber and literally you're just left with kind of flavored sugar-water a little vitamin C or something so actually in case of apple juice no vitamin C really at all although they probably add it afterwards anyway so so yeah prune juice maybe in the in the middle there and not as bad as some of these other juices though why not just eat some brooms okay or plums it is plum season it's stone fruit season at least where I am here on the East Coast I just got some of my CSA my Community Supported Agriculture and the boy - I love plums all right I just had two for lunch um okay LeAnn LeAnn is now responding to at Alexandra D I'm not sure what the question was okay Nicole is the next question but how long should you wait after drinking green tea to eat a meal uh or how long after meal to drink it so what Nicole is presumably but referring to is the ability of green tea and black tea any kind of tea from the tea plant like long tea anyway white tea is that it can block the absorption of iron so having tea and a meal in your stomach at the same time is not ideal for the absorption of non heme iron so so I encourage people to drink tea separate from their meals and the question great question so a second house separate so the concept is not having food and the tea in your stomach Ascenta so before a meal pure liquid drains very quickly out of your stomach so like you had tea an hour before meal it would be totally out before you probably I mean maybe like half an hour for meal but after a meal right the foods in your stomach for awhile depending on what you'll eat how much you eat it I mean it could take hours for your stomach empty look if you given an hour to head start then drink some tea you know you know that wouldn't be as much a problem but basically that's the thinking right so te kind of on an empty stomach although some people actually it irritates their stomachs and drink tea the tannins and tea these bitter compounds actually sometimes give people a stomach ache if they drink it onto stomach in which case don't do that I'm alright let me see where are we here Sidhant asks what are some alternatives people with serotonin deficiency who take SSRIs selective serotonin reuptake to manage their condition okay so I have videos on that so I videos on SSRI antidepressants I'm questioning there in fact the whole kind of serotonin theory may not actually be legit I mean that that depression is a state of serotonin deficiency that's kind of controversial but there are certainly things you can do to improve the conditions for which SSRIs are often prescribed such as depression so just type in antidepressants or depression just depression into the shushing Baxter org all the videos will pop up there is actually serotonin in plant foods actual real serotonin like in your brain in plant foods but doesn't cross the blood-brain barrier but does but what does is the precursor to search on tryptophan and I have a video talking about how you can optimize the absorption so basically took Japan in the context of low protein can facilitate its serotonin levels in the brain so I think it was butternut squash seeds raising that video about but no so anyway check out the videos and and there's lots of things you can eat that may improve your mood Felicia asked my hope my whole body's itching what could be the cause and what to do about it what to do about it is the first part of the question find the cause so itchiness all over can be a consequence potentially serious conditions like liver or kidney problems or it could just be some like you know you're like having a hypersensitivity reaction to like the fabric softener or something in your clothes or something so important things find out what it is and then treat the cause rather than trying to like use some kind of anti-itch cream or something so so make an appointment see your medical professional and get to the bottom of it although you can kind of think you're in your own mind what who might have been exposed to in terms of some kind of contact dermatitis or anyway and if you're getting hives it's a whole nother story kind of swellings in the skin but you see your doctor can get to the bottom of it rather than just turn it cover up the symptoms okay Debra asked this turmeric need to be eaten with a fat Oh for best absorption I've got a video about that eating turmeric with fat does improve the absorption from the fat soluble nutrients in it and so yes I would encourage you to you know throw some nuts seeds or avocado onto a tumor dish I would do it so for people that take vitamin D supplements which is typically an oily form or a preformed DHA this long-chain omega-3s if you if you just took those any time you're running when you're eating turmeric if you're gonna take a mint I might as well do a tumor cuz then that little fat on there will increase the absorption if for whatever reason army nuts seeds and nut butter see butters are avocado in the house Lee Anne says see oh how nice I'll Dan says please sell them the sushi facts sure it's made from 100% organic cotton oh that's a great question I'm presuming that whatever we're using it's not under percent organic all right well if you go to Nutrition Facts that or click on the contact button and leave a message saying please try to find organic shirts we will see if we can source those it depends on whether who are the vendor we use has that in stock but I'd love to offer that okay Leanne new company leaf side yes I was just talking about leaf side on on Facebook a new company leased ourselves free dried just said what a meals based on my deal he doesn't yes I have heard of them how much nutrition is lost and free drying yeah it's a good question yeah so that's that's actually what I just talked about on Facebook yes um so I encourage you to check them out so they came up so if it's all we know when there's just overwhelming science it suggests that eating healthy has all sorts of benefits and this so the question is really okay that right I mean anyone who delves into this will quickly become convinced by the overwhelming mountain of evidence the question is okay well how do you make a convenient tell I mean I did actually get it incorporated into your life and from and look for me that's difficult not when I'm at home when I have control over and I put it on traveling around and find myself stuck in airport food courts I'm trying to dig up something that's healthy it can be a real challenge and so that's why I personally was really excited about the Leeside food so yeah it's a just add water but just green light ingredients right so""), Document(metadata={'description': 'Every month I go live from my treadmill to answer your questions here on YouTube and on Facebook.

recommend colloidal silver in fact you can become silver poisoned by ingesting some people put it up their nose and you should not use silver internally you can get actually get a disease turns your skin strange color now is there a role for chloride or silver in topical applications outside the body perhaps in some rare circumstances of multi drug-resistant bacteria but that is not something that people should be using willy-nilly and certainly not internally I can't pronounce I'm so sorry I can't pronounce some of these names Joaquin so uh where'd you go okay stinky boom boom let's thank you boom boom asks I don't place a weird sticky boob no go I need to increase my the size of my chat window here okay I was so close to stinky boom-boom okay then it just disappeared I'm so sorry Ms boom-boom or mr. boom-boom okay I'm sorry I gotta go back to the bottom because it's growing up so quickly okay umm any story about BP and vegan Omar asks any story about BP blood pressure and a vegan diet absolutely I have a whole chapter on blood pressure in the book we've known since the nineteen twenties that high blood pressure need not occur my researchers measured the blood pressures at a thousand people living in rural Kenya published in The Lancet right of the most prestigious medical journal in the world 1929 and our blood pressures go up at we as we ate sets up a sixty the majority of us are hypertensive where is their eating a diet centered around fruits vegetables wild dark green leafy vegetables including and beans they're both pressures actually go down as they age in fact down to the ideal blood pressure so there's no benefit from reducing further blood pressure of 110 over 70 that's where we should all be working on and they got there naturally just eating healthy I miss anything with rural China 110 over 70 their entire lives 70 year old same average book pressures 16 year old and again what was you know what's the Venn diagram of the rural African nation diets it was plant-based that they need only not special occasions why do we things the plant-based nature their debts it was some protective because in the Western world according the American Heart Association the only folks getting it down that low are those eating strictly plant-based diets coming in average 110 over 65 so the to answer your question BP and vegan diets average 110 over 65 perfect ideal blood pressures so that's the nine people to go on and treat the cause if however you are on blood pressure medication you need to do this with supervision of your physician because they need to wrap it they may need to rapidly wean you off these blood pressure medications because you can't be on blood pressure man if you treat the call as eliminating our blood pressure can't be on blood pressure pills with normal blood pressure you drop your pressures too low you get dizzy fall over can hurt yourself so ironically the side effects are not having to take drugs or having to take fewer drugs so please work with your physician closely to wean yourself off these medications everything getting off completely and then not suffer the side effect and more importantly treat the cause of the disease okay any research on recovery for vegan athletes asked Ricky Kay with lots of question marks yeah I got a bunch of videos coming up on on on plant-based athletes and indeed that seems to be the key as the recovery time just because the anti-inflammatory nature of the diet it just allows people to to train that much harder but of course the secret is in the training not the diet the die just helps you enables you to train more but you still have to actually do the training no magic bullet all right Michael Stigall Stiggy Stigall SRU of course I'm to turn a treadmill on my walk about 17 miles a day of course tomorrow I'm gonna be in a plane on my butt all day but when I'm home if two of my diet roll of my life yes I'm on a treadmill day I'm working a treadmill desk I can you're a mound not tip to the camera down you'll see my well I don't know if you'll see then um that's my I got my keyboard I got my I got everything there um so yeah so then I can get work done does that actually show okay all right I knew I should have put pants on and yeah I'm treadmill because said being sedentary is not good for you even if you exercise even if you are you know go to the gym after work sitting down for six hours or more a day associated with living a significantly shorter lifespan I've got some videos about that check it out what is my input on the lemon first thing in the morning fine with me um I would just rinse your mouth out with water after eating that lemon or any citrus or any sour food so is not to a road your dental enamel okay Evan asks oh darn it Evan asked okay I'm not scroll up see if I'm ketchup yes should we limit soy intake I encouraged I think the sweet spot was three to five servings a day if I remember my own videos correctly because that high at two over five servings a day you can increase your levels of igf-1 insulin-like growth factor moments a cancer promoter growth hormone associated with animal protein consumption but enough soy protein you can get higher idea for on levels to which is not a good thing Elizabeth asks should humans fast that is a fantastic question there's a rich literature now I wanted to do fasting videos but there was just no science out there but now there's just been this burst of science and Clark restriction into meeting intermittent fasting water only fasting and also it's a really cool data and I can't wait to dig through and do a whole series of videos I hear you and the videos are coming subscribe at nutrition facts the bargain you will be the first to know when the first fasting video goes up alright how chloe Parker asks how do I feel about the work of ring Crowe nice I think Ray is a genius brilliant guy we share a lot of research anytime I come across a really interesting paper that I think would be helped it's work I send it to him he returns the favor he's got a book he's working a book called I think our broken plates something like that and I'm so excited for its release he's already published in the peer-reviewed medical Aries a former NASA engineer smart guy kind of reminds me of Pritikin right someone out of medical background just an engineering background and just wants to know the facts just show me the data and he's done a deep dive in the nutrition of literature and really has some fascinating stuff and I've done one video I think about his work I got a bunch more videos coming out about his work hey simple question as short films ABC macros what percentage the question is like should like 80/10/10 or what's the percentage of macronutrients from protein carbs and fat and the answer is it's the source that matters is dr. David Katz likes to say carbohydrates are lentils and lollipops so you can't say should eat more or less carbohydrates because what does that mean same thing with fat fat is lard if that is walnuts when the healthiest foods right you have talked about sources longer sources whole plant foods um I'm more interested with eating whole plant foods would then whether or not you're eating high or low fat or but you know so so as long as they're whole food source of fat and I talking about a while talking about and nuts seeds avocados those are health promoting foods I encourage people to eat up palmful actually uh nuts every day that's actually one of my daily doesn't another one is the tablespoon of ground flax seeds and so it's not it's fat good or bad it's the source whole food sources of fat carbs and protein or your best bet is okay t5 carrots a day ask Jackie it is okay to eat five carrots a day and even better dip those carrots and some bean dip or hummus or and time that you're making me hungry okay how can chem 2020s can your blood type dictate your eating habits I've got videos about the blood type diet or blood type astrology but that to me it seems the same as asking does my just my horoscope have anything to do with what I should eat and so the scientific community has been rightly very skeptical of that work and sees it more as a marketing gimmick than having any supportive at science um Maggie asked how can you increase your fertility actually very similar for both men and women it's eating a healthy plant-based diet though there was a the the Adventists too just had a sperm count diet that found I think that sperm counts of vegans was lower I have that that study doing everybody get just noted the the title abstract and I will do a video about it but in general I've got videos on fertility and low in saturated fat intake Siva soon someone in the plant-based would have improved fertility I will check out the study and letting you know what about a healthy vegan weight gain for strengthening athletes s Loukas so healthy if you add the word healthy in there then we're talking about whole plant foods um you know for athletes that are spending a lot of energy particularly swimmers they're just losing so much humanity EFT you know even thousands of extra calories a day you know that can be challenging on a plant-based diet because their foods are relatively clerkly dilute I mean you have to huge amounts of food now for most people that's a good thing it's hard just hard to get in excess of calories on a plant-based diet so great for weight loss but if you're actually trying to maintain a kind of endurance athlete my lifestyle where you know you're doing you know four or five thousand calories a day the way to do that is eat more eat more frequently even more calorically dense so we're talking nuts nut butters avocados smoothies you can kind of sneak liquid calories past your body and kind of fool the body a little bit so you know dried""), Document(metadata={'description': 'Every month I go live from my treadmill to answer your questions here on YouTube and on Facebook.

reverse atherosclerosis I have both the crawdads blocked um and these suggestions oh okay lots of questions know the best way of Versailles service closest is a whole food plant-based diet as shown by Pritikin Ornish and Esselstyn I've got a lot of videos about that um and so gonti says that grantees eating vegan but of course vegan doesn't mean healthy vegan can be coca-cola and potato chips and you know god knows what and so encourage you to sent your dad around whole plant foods um and also of course mono a cluster I was doing else or other things and suggestions for getting fat soluble antioxidants yes you eat lots of nuts and seeds to facilitate the absorption of the carotenoid phytonutrients found in greens all right what are maple flavor ice what's my top three easiest meals easiest meals well easy snack something like but an apple but now piece of rhubarb as he says you can't comes prepackaged and like an edible packaging you just eat it can't be marking me then that anyone who says oh i'd love to eat healthy but it's just not convenient has never met an apple right okay but meals what's an easiest meal um well I mean you could boil some whole wheat pasta right takes 10 minutes um and throw in a bag of frozen greens and a can of a drink can of beans and you're done right oh and sweeter sauce right in a thing tomato sauce and then you mix it all up so you got greens beans tomato and then spices just add like a you know tiny seasoning spice mix boom meal is done you got your beans you get your greens got the whole grains good that's an easy meal another easy meal okay how we take some yellow toward corn tortillas right I'm sprouted might even be better you take them out I can get them frozen so you can always have Mandi and you put them in the toaster oven you very very lightly toast them and you take them out and then you put some fat-free you know refried beans for my kin on them or you nicely heat it up first you heat it up yeah some diced onion I'm pouring some salsa cut or anything and put it on there and then you have my little tortilla thingy on that super easy what's another good super easy one for breakfast you can make my cherry chocolate mill when you take make some steel cut oats I discuss our yummy nice and chewy and then you add a drain can of tart cherries just tart cherries and water and some cocoa powder it's a date syrup or something and you have this like warm chocolate place like you're eating the chocolate covered cherries for breakfast super yummy delicious for a bonus add some fresh mint leaves that you're growing on your windowsill right now because care about your health right okay Patricia Poletti asks I've heard for years that needing promoted excuse me the sugar promotes cancer that's what got a whole series of videos coming out about that my short answer is no I mean so basically you know the whole thought is well cancer eats sugar so does all ourselves it's like saying Hitler breathes air breathed air so you shouldn't breathe air what I mean yeah but normal you know non villainous people also breathe air like it doesn't make a lot of sense anyway I'm not saying sugars good for you I think we should cut out all that in the sugars from the dead okay maple flava is back I'm saying do I use a wire to still have no Martin distiller seems to me to I waste of energy resilient H tasks we're Cleef ight information on a healthy level of fitness at different ages what we should be able to do oh that's interesting like how many pushups should be able to do at age 70 or whatever um I've never run across anything like that if anyone has any suggestions for a resilient age please write them in the comments rekka Tonko asks what are key supplements for mental illness a most important thing is a healthy diet period and exercise actually can improve load if we're talking about depression means I'm trying to think if I have stuff on saffron let me see saffron lavender and you just got a type of mental illness whatever particular mental illness you're interested in and nutrition facts are to pull up all the foods now I encourage you to just I mean you just make things with you know make Paia with your saffron I'm sure you could take it in capsules as a supplement if you really wanted to um Rebecca asked can it should a Crohn's a patient take probiotics and a multivitamin Crohn's patients should eat healthfully I have not reviewed the probiotics Crohn's Liz you're in a while but I think of something really phenomenal that popped up I would have heard about it and I mean dependent I mean if you're a Crohn's patient that has much of your intestine removed and you might run into Vitamin kind of absorption issues but that be something you talk to you or physician about in terms of what parts your intestine and intestinal tract have been removed and then talk about what particular nutrient deficiencies you might run into certainly see a lot of problem with that with people getting these kind of gastric bypass operations running into serious nutrient deficiencies but if you have your entire gut then you should be able to get all your nutrients from the produce aisle with the exception of vitamin b12 and vitamin T all right Jesse Byrne tick sorry if I'm mispronouncing everybody's names ah says I always put my questions on YouTube every month in advance and they never show up well it just did and so if this was a question instead of saying them I would answer it anyway Leanne a yes I came across something called alkaloid build-up um and it being important to rotate your greens that sounds like that just sounds like crazy talk to me it sounds like there's someone on the internet trying to get clicks by confusing people maple flavor so should I trust the added vitamins b12 etc in my daily great value bran flakes oh can you rely on them as it's being really there like if it says that it must be twelve um should you trust your brand Flake manufacturer well ideally we probably should be eating bran flakes I mean presumably I mean most cold cereals with very few exceptions are pretty bad for you they have a lot of it sugar at its salt there's a few exceptions like Uncle Sam cereal basically has like I think two ingredients right rolled whole wheat berries and like flax seeds but but anything processed like that it's just not a very healthy food but in terms of does it actually have the vitamins that it that it says probably although vitamin b12 was so critically important for people eating plant-based diets I wouldn't necessarily rely on rely on their word for it um Adam a wants to play asks any videos about the benefits of being in nature oh cool Japanese first bathing you know I've never heard about that I'm even know how I ran across it probably because I put in maybe if I put in like green leafy vegetables or something and they caught the word green pubmed and anyway there's this very interesting body of literature about the purported health benefits of being in nature now of course you can imagine all the co-founders who's in nature people actually have to kind of walk into nature so this exercise then there's like fresh air there's sunshine so is being in nature actually good for you beyond just all those other things like if you walked on a treadmill and had fresh air and sunshine would it be the same as being surrounded by forests so they do these studies where they're I put people in front of a TV screen and they show you before oh you lots of green but you're actually not in a forest maybe there's some like you know you know pine needle compounds in the air that are beneficial anyway you can imagine how difficult those kind of studies are but there have been a couple well-designed studies I'm actually gonna do a series of videos on that very topic stay to Rebecca and not Vieira asks when you have your appendix taken out should you change your diet at all um well you should vastly improve your diet as appendicitis is is kind of a consequence of eating a measurable Western low fiber diet so something like appendicitis is rare among population centers their diets are not whole plant food so that's probably just you should take that as a sign that you haven't mean enough flavor containing foods predominately beans and old grains and so you should bump it up a notch TJ a Cassandra G oh I think somebody TJ is responding to X is on dry Maria um vs a my concern about studies showing it about hormones instead of showing up in tap water from people flushing prescription medications actually sometimes it's actually not just flushing it just gets excreted unchanged in the urine so they're just taking the medications than peeing the medication straight into the water supply mom and so I said video about that I'm talking about they you know how much prozac builds up in fish flush because of all the stuff that's dumped into Waterways so check out that video she probably searched for Prozac I think prozac doing the UM drugs it should pop right up maybe prozac in water all right Maria V asks what do you eat drink for energy to beat the afternoon slump my

miss everybody want to see everyone but you know it's not worth getting covered over it I hate being sick on the road you know switch to Virtual but then I'm like I want to see everybody I've been stuck in my house for years and so as I finally okay and so I was just so excited to tell the organizers I'm coming covered be damned got coming ah anyway and actually suffered from and I've kind of this rare side effect which continues to bug me so anyway I should take my own advice next up Mike says we're oh but oh would I recommend take vegans taking vitamin K2 something I just did a webinar on that um and the answer is no why um because there's uh no data suggesting vitamin K2 does anything the vitamin K1 doesn't do um and vitamin K1 where is that found and found in dark green leafy vegetables um and so there's purported benefits of K2 for heart and bones and um our bones and what was the other thing hard bones are the third anyway it doesn't work for any of them in fact there was a big Scandal of fraudulent data fabrication anyway even if we did find out there are some unique benefits to vitamin K2 our body makes K2 not only a microbiome from vitamin K1 but the cells in our body make k2 from K1 just like the animals that we eat they're animals War animals mammals do it we're mammals so we make k2 um from the K1 that we eat but of course we have to eat K1 how do we do that eat our greens um Kira says can diet oh yeah that can cause pancreatitis um I have pancreatic insufficiency but don't drink or smoke so yeah so alcohol um alcohol binge can give you pancreatitis um but pancreatic insufficiency you know there's two functions main functions of the pancreas there's the endocrine functions or like making insulin and the exocrine functions actually spits out hormones to abduct into our digestive tract um helps with digestion and that's what you typically think of with pancreatic insufficiency though I that's I don't think of that as being related necessarily drinking or smoking so ideally treat the cause um and then there are some dietary tweaks if there's nothing you can do to kind of help with the symptoms pancreatic insufficiency but ideally find out what's causing the first place treat the cause and reverse the condition that's always the uh the best way to go Jonah says how to eat when you already had to mention how to pressure hospitals and Care Homes to give this food oh good question well you know Dr Dean ornish right now after conquering killing number one heart disease and uh showing the first time in a randomized control trial you can actually um reverse the progression of cancer in this case early stage prostate cancer with the plant-based diet says all right I'm just getting started let's see if we can reverse Alzheimer's disease with the whole world plant-based diet um and it's currently running that trial now we don't have the results back yet it's not done but I'm excited to report what it does and if we do find out that indeed um diets can help then it's all about getting good food to our loved ones in terms of individual Foods there's lots associated with prevention trying to think of any um but the only thing comes to mind immediately in terms of slowing the progression um would be controlling cardiovascular risk factors so controlled cholesterol high blood pressure can actually slow the progression of Alzheimer's dementia which certainly has to do with our food um there will be certainly a lot more the biggest chapter is uh the dementia chapter preserving your mind in how not to age looking forward to that coming out in fact if I didn't have so many questions I could look up that chapter right now and see if there's any particular um foods that have been put to the test nothing jumps to mind it's mostly in the prevention realm um unfortunately okay please help says Rose do I know of anything about ehlers danlos um yes that's like this hyper flexibility um syndrome ah just diagnosed of a whole food plant-based diet oh stomach pain I wonder if that's related so you typically think of um Ruble danlos uh with like problems with one's heart uh problems with ones uh you can run into joint problems there's skin changes I don't think of of uh severe stomach pain so I'm going to assume that that's a separate um and so one shouldn't just kind of ignore it it's like oh well I got this syndrome so that's why I got stomach pain you really you're not your physician really your or your Healthcare professional really should look into why you have severe stomach pain and it could be something serious and something easily fixable um some like an ulcer or something um and so you want to get that checked out oh serious says can uh caffeine really affect anxiety that's a good question um let's uh let's look really quick show me um oh I'm doing a whole series on anxiety oh although I don't think I'm I I cover caffeine so yeah in in scripting my next you know the uspsdf the United States preventive Services Task Force recently suggested uh we should be screening kids for anxiety um which seems like a huge gift to the pharmaceutical industry this thing going to want to um drug these kids but the question is so what are their what are the lifestyle approaches to anxiety um and so I'm going to do a whole series um and so you know I'll include looking into something like caffeine let's look at uh on anxiety for those with panic disorder it turns out um yeah um so caffeine dose is roughly equivalent to five cups of coffee and Deuces panic attacks in a large proportion of panic disorder patients also increases anxiety and panic disorder patients as well as among healthy adults at these doses so it sounds like if you have panic disorder should not be drinking five cups of coffee worth of caffeine at least according to the latest systematic review on the subject published in in 2022 okay Dr Greger this is Galactus yeah you don't seem to advocate for a mostly fruit diet why um and so uh the video is one of my paleo diet videos and it talks about how whether or not we're kind of like mostly for divorce mostly fullivores I think was the video um whether mostly Are we more like the like the leaf-eating monkeys or the fruit eating monkeys and we are more towards the fruit eating monkeys but that's a different thing from saying we're frugivores uh yes fruit it's a important part of our ancestral diet and so why don't I recommend for mostly fruit dad because there's an entire class of foods that are healthier than fruit and they're called vegetables what is the vegetable vegetables any other type part of the plant that's not the fruit so there's root vegetables stem vegetables like celery rhubarb leafy vegetables flour vegetables like cauliflower um and there's actually higher nutrient density in those then in fruits and so if you get a lot of fruits you wouldn't maybe not get enough vegetables in your diet there's really so much stomach room only somebody hours you need in the day and so want people to get all these other wonderful parts of the plan into your daily diet all right Stephanie Stephanie is confused because sometimes uh I read you need b12 with methodox which one should I be taking cyanical Bauman I already have videos saying why Santa clausman's better I have another video coming out because people continue to get this message from people that are selling you methylcobalamin because it's more expensive but Santa Claus is more shelf-stable and so more likely to actually contain B12 and since B12 is kind of important um you want to make sure that you actually get it so that's why I recommend cyanica Baldwin okay and Maxine said as well what's the worst thing I ate recently well in five days it's my birthday it's my 50th birthday in five days and so we actually just went on a nutrition fact staff Retreat and they're so sweet they made me a cake which was actually a big black bean brownie so that was super healthy but to make the 50 they did a little marshmallows yes I ate some marshmallows that's the worst thing I ate recently okay seba can I explain why sugar is bad for our health I'm an athlete not worried about calories so indeed sugar uh causes cavities um Dental cavities um if you say well I don't care about cavities okay so it's empty calories and you say wait a second I don't care about calories well so you don't worry about getting excess calories but you know we only have a certain amount in the calorie Bank every day if you're an athlete you have more than others the concern is that you are you know if you eat 100 calories of sugar for example you are in effect certainly over time excluding 100 calories of something else you could be eating though I mean 100 calories sugar gets you effectively is Zero nutrition whereas 100 calories broccoli 100 calories strawberries 100 calories almost anything else any other whole plant food gave you tons of nutrition and you're just leaving that all on the table when you eat sugar so uh yeah those are some reasons why we shouldn't waste calories on sugar CEST TLD says any recommended food or unrecommended food for type 1 diabetes uh it'd be the same recommendation for type 2 diabetics is type 1 diabetics what we're trying to do is improve insulin sensitivity so that's the responsiveness of our liver and muscles to insulin weather created by our pancreas if we have type 2 diabetes or whether it's um we inject it which is type 1 diabetes and sometimes type 2 diabetes as well um and so we want every unit of insulin to do as much good as possible so we don't have to so we inject less insulin which is good in terms of cancer risk and other and cost God so we are making our body as responsive as possible and the way we do that is we decrease our saturated fat intake I would also say trans fat but there's not much trans fat in our food supply anymore so decrease saturated fat intake that interferes with insulin singling um and our muscles and liver and so it doesn't work as""), Document(metadata={'description': 'Every month I go live from my treadmill to answer your questions here on YouTube and

all these studies done on rats but the first human study was done on leave it was like five six cups of wild blueberries a day it was a pilot studies just wanted to see look can any amount of blueberries actually improve cognitive health and it did and there's a randomized control study you can give people powdered blueberries versus fake blueberry powder that looks like blueberry census and they same number cell calories and everything but it actually doesn't have anything blueberry in it that's how you can do read my specific control trials with berries and so but then finally and that's I have a new video coming out about the until now video of what about kind of doable level somewhere so they did one cup of blueberries and got significant improvements in various dimensions of cognitive function among older adults and works for kids too a really remarkable study how much was it I forget how many blueberries it was but they gave kids but not like you know eight weeks of a couple day of blueberries but one meal single meal goobers got significant boost in cognitive functions so like that's what you feed your kids in the morning they have their exams but literally within hours of consumption Romilly thinks the polyphenol phytonutrients actually go through the blood-brain barrier and can get into our brain have all sorts of wonderful Thanks so eat berries for your brain all right and lots of other stuff I've got a whole chapter on a brain disease in how not to die all proceeds from ourselves my books go to charity of course all right Linda Linda got my new cookbook yes let me know what you think Linda Shawna is back how much vitamin D Oh talked about that to destinations a day Austin years is back is me so healthy um me so healthy yes yes miso is a whole soy food and despite as I said and content is not associated with stomach cancer or high blood pressure as normally high sodium foods would be so yes it's healthy and that's actually what we use in the cookbook to make things salty and savory use miso use a whole food every single ingredient of every single recipe monitoring cookbook is health promoting it's a whole complan food a green light food all right Deborah what diet do I recommend for cats you need to ask a veterinarian I am a veterinarian but a very restricted one knowing only one species and that's almost a peon so can help you there Olivier is back what's the function oh we talked about the appendix all right Julia are there any foods that can help me establish a better sleeping pattern ooh ten net problems falling asleep yeah I actually do have I have videos on tart cherries but you bike and you can also buy and concentrate by whole can cherries and water and the on kiwifruit I don't know if that was the yellow kiwifruit a green kiwifruit in terms of sleep and I just did just scripted the video that's coming up that on on these melatonin and the problem with multum supplements is that if you actually go so the study looked at 31 brands off the shelves and the purity and the strength was completely off what some delayed well unfortunately our supplement industry so far the regulate you just cannot know what's in the bottle it says it has like there were some chewables that said at one point five milligrams of melatonin so chewables that's what kids might take actually had 9 milligrams that's like hundred times physiological normal levels and so and not just strength but purity found of these contaminants these under identified the contaminants some of which look surprisingly like that horrible tryptophan contaminant back in the 80s that killed dozens of people and sickened thousands again that's the problem with some in industry but but so wouldn't it be nice to get but so but the these studies show that ball tonin does actually help with sleep in high enough doses and so that's like if I had plateaus or five milligrams but you don't you take the supplements because of purity and potency issues so what do you do if only there was a best of both worlds way to do it if only melatonin was hard enough safe simple side-effect free solution food we've known since 1995 that plants have melatonin and which plants though I mean in enough that actually affects melatonin levels in the blood absolutely sorry there was I do have one state where talks about how you randomized people eating more vegetables less vegetable so you actually show they're more melatonin eating vegetables but almond but but the updated video talks about how they did these fruit studies they had people eat pineapples oranges I forget what the third one was anyway so you can you I mean you can show you can get these levels but the problem is so I was talking about jetlag and it's like you can't take a it's harder to pack a pineapple in your suitcase I'm is there anything like small you could do and so I talk about each food category how much melatonin is in each food so actually like look we make melatonin so animals deducing from melatonin and meat but with the highest melatonin meat is Sam and I think and you'd have to eat like 200 pounds of salmon and a single meal to get the mountain effect so that's that's a that's off the table whole grains there was a corn strain the yellow corn strain now eyes levels begin 16 years I mean a single meal way too much scratch dad the highest highest vegetable was white mushrooms and you only have to eat like forget it was like 2 pounds but 2 pounds of mushrooms like 10 cups of mushrooms because it's a light so all right scratch that so mushrooms have 100 times more than meat but still doesn't help you and then through cranberries to the rescue a single ounce single ounce of cranberries can give you a physiological dose of melatonin and but so you could actually do that you can do smoothie um so any in the evening you have a strawberry excuse me cranberry smoothie announce the cranberries like that's a cranberry um and and look you could actually travel with cranberries right they wouldn't smoosh through the but then what do you do when you get there right it's not like you can pack your blender with you too so thankfully tada a long story short pistachios the most nutrient excuse me melatonin rich nut pistachio smelled highest melatonin rich food anywhere like off-the-charts high levels of melatonin I'm to get a physical physiological serene is to to what you asked know to like to pistachios actually physiological those melatonin extraordinay so like a handful pistachios would be like a high dose melatonin supplement but without the contaminants etc anyway try that try the Kiwi froze tart cherries and pistachios and see and replug bag and tell me if you're sleeping better of course there's all sorts of sleep hygiene things I assume you're already doing dark and cold and you know all the things that help you sleep better anyway alright moving right along oh my got 10 minutes left I was just excited about this my all-time videos ok Laura asks you can get all they make three oh yeah what Lauren says you can get all your mega three to me from romaine lettuce that's so not true but if you need more search YouTube anyway um you know I mean as a percentage of fat I'm sure there's a lot of mega threes and romaine lettuce like there are in all greens but you know how much fat is in romaine lettuce it's not a lot of fat so it can be a hundred percent of mega threes you I mean you have seen a wheelbarrow presumably worth of romaine to get you know like two grams of al a day so I disagree respectively respectfully um Michelle asks Oh Michelle is talking to Julia roten as hi is it risky what causes it um I assumed wrote in his meaning MCB I'm on blood tests for vegans as a mean corpuscular volume yeah that could be a sign of vitamin b12 deficiency also be assigned a Foley deficiency but if you're vegan you probably get a lot of Foley because that's found in beans and greens China asked what's my opinion of a log diet and Chris people need both a combination of raw and cooked foods cooking actually improves nutrition of some vegetables because is not what you eat it's what you absorb and so you can you know quadruple the amount of beta-carotene in your bloodstream you didn't cook carrots great raw carrots and improves like a being human bioavailability and the red pigment tomato so process tomato products actually healthier than raw tomato products and on down the list but but raw foodist have it right that we should all sit down a big salads every day but you know I'd put the you know legumes and you know some you know beans canned beans and nuts and seeds and my delicious okay uh and if anyone for whatever reason really doesn't want to eat hundred percent wrong which I wouldn't recommend but if you do um you need to get a book called the coming raw by brenda davis entre molina my you could do it healthy it just takes a lot work Julie as fight something salty but I have it with kale with the harmful effects that certainly become a right by the healthy components of me aloo well in certain I mean so you simply salty I'd be bad for your blood pressure but eating that kale and broccoli that you mentioned in your question these are nitrate containing vegetables which actually improve my electric nitric oxide production can actually improve blood pressure his lower blood pressure so yeah it would actually counteract that negative effect but guess what but um but then you kind of cancel things out I mean don't you want to eat stuff that actually improves your health not just as neutral for your health that's why I would encourage you to eat the kale without the salt if you want something salty I mean ideally we you know look we don't add salt in the kitchen or the dining room table we don't eat processed foods which is where most of the salt comes from""), Document(metadata={'description': 'Live Q&A on July 26th\n\nSubscribe to my

Greger okay please tell them about the best plant-based strategy for bad arthritis okay so the question is what kind of arthritis do you have mentioned that there was a family history so room well I would guess it doesn't really matter rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis actually very similar diet seems to help with both a diet packed with anti-inflammatory foods might so whole food plant-based diet we have decent date on rheumatoid arthritis at least knee osteoarthritis there's not much on certain other types of arthritis like ankylosing spondylitis but I certainly can't hurt seems a nice healthy anti-inflammatory diet but as always got treat the cause there she affects just causes that that don't need diet they need antibiotics so you need to find out what's causing arthritis and hopefully try to to treat the cause although a healthy diet will help regardless with your life because it's a healthy diet elite a lean e Li any and asks what is the best strategy for going out birth control pill previously covered in very persistent acne after quitting usually that's temporary and should kind of equilibrate or at least has been in my experience innocent lamb looked into I do have some videos on treating acne like with barberries I was just talking about in the other on the other QA but again I don't know if there's some protocol that would make that less likely Louis Mahon as how often do we need to replenish antioxidant levels so it makes sense to put some amla powder in glass and water I bring to bed and sit during the night um you don't have this really and what I found to be intriguing serious Nvidia on like what's your RDA for antioxidants like what's the recommended daily allowance I think it's a series of three videos where I talk about how the targets for men and women in terms of how my on antioxidant unisys you get every day and then I go through all the different foods all right well if when you did 15,000 or whatever how you gonna do it okay here's your oatmeal this is where you get to and if you had a little cinnamon boof all of a sudden you're up to here and there's and then so I check out those videos I bet if you take just type in antioxidants into nutrition facts that are hard we actually just updated our search engine and this month I think last month so it's really much nicer than it used to be Thank You Christy and so you should be able to find those those series of videos on exactly how much you need how to reach it and as you'll see in those videos it's super easy to do it but you just have to eat really healthy foods so no there's no reason you need to sip on some special glass of Amla water you can get all the antioxidants you need from foods if you eat healthy enough and those videos will help you do that emcee sebastian asks is five milligrams melatonin supplements daily long-term safe there's so much scientific evidence about benefits but their concern that hormones declining as age do not take notes supplements um y-you say well just trust me until the video the videos already I don't know I can look it up I'm let me see if it's in then this next batch of videos um volume we're up to volume 43 can you believe that oh yeah here it is video 4319 our melatonin supplements safe alright so where are we now oh we are on three so in 16 videos 16 videos from today our melatonin supplements safe so you can see all the data and why but spoiler it cut to the chase don't take melatonin supplements you'll find out in 16 videos all right hacks I'm 21 says please talk about 9 Jen I've never heard of night Jen can't talk about it hex I'm 21 says or NAD+ I can talk about I'd presumably as a supplement my NAD+ is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide i think that it's a coenzyme in the body your body makes it you don't need to eat it no reason take supplement but I bet the people that are trying to sell you NAD+ have a different opinion Louis Mellon says is there any evidence eating in season foods is healthier or that like different ethnic groups are particularly suited for different foods and the answer is no no I guess n-no so in season foods well so there may be environmental benefits too you know buying locally in season but but if you just care about your health the fact that we can eat blueberries all year round without even having to get you be probably fresh blueberries all year round I'm so of course you can just see some frozen that's a wonderful thing about our modern world and that you know I have to do live off of like turnips during the winter and so yeah eat healthy foods all year-round period would be my take on that in terms of ethnic groups eating different foods I mean it's remarkable that around the world people eat vastly different diets but you know but the reason we know that people aren't somehow kind of their genetics have something new it is because of these migration studies where you take people I take someone lives in Japan they moved to San Francisco even living like a San Franciscan and they start dying from all these San Francisco diseases and less of these so they you know their prostate cancer rates shoot up if their man the but their stomach cancer rates you down this all the sudden they're not dating all this little salted fermented veggies that they were eating in Japan anyway so no we we're all humans and healthy food is healthy food regardless of what kind of human you are e Moana Beach says one of the best ways to increase saliva Munna says talks about a dry mouth due to anxiety and so the pureed foods liquids and I try the food I hold my breath is alive isn't breaking down can help okay increase love so what I would do is whether it's actually conditioned there's a variety of conditions that can actually cause dry mouth and so there's person salivary glands or section now the muta C's that can do it seem to go to your doctor find out what it is so you can treat the cause and if it is anxiety then there's things you can do to treat anxiety so it's not about well I'm just gonna eat lots of wet food no let's treat the cause find out what's causing the first place treat that so then you can eat any kind of healthy food you want um okay um una asks how to breathe when there's no air gets into distress sounds like an like hangs a panic attack uh yeah it sounds like a panic attack but you need to go get treated for panic attacks it's a horrible horrible sensation unfortunately I don't think there's anything there's been no studies I'm aware of on diet and panic attacks no there are one can imagine lifestyle interventions something like stress management maybe meditation things like that things which I am no expert and so I am not familiar with that literature but hopefully on your physician can point you in the right direction Maria ve asked top recommendation for vegan protein when trying to work out build muscles trainers recommending protein shakes but smart Maria would prefer to avoid processed food can you imagine anything more process than protein powder it's like everything's been removed except the grunting and then of course they add also it's a crap in and hope I'll visit can begin on coming up to Toronto soon so anyway yeah what's the best way to get vegan protein I weigh beans right anyone doesn't know how to get protein on a plant-based diet doesn't know beans""), Document(metadata={'description': 'Calories eaten in the morning count less and are healthier than calories eaten in the evening.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a

The best of both worlds was demonstrated in 2018— time-restricted feeding into a narrow window earlier in the day. Individuals randomized to eat the same food, but just in an 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. eating window, experienced a drop in blood pressures, oxidative stress, and insulin resistance even when all the study subjects were maintained at the same weight. Same food, same weight, but with different results. The drops in blood pressures were extraordinary, from 123/82 down to 112/72 in five weeks, comparable to the effectiveness of potent blood pressure drugs. The longest study to date on time- restricted feeding only lasted 16 weeks, a pilot study with no control group that only involved eight people, but the results are still worth noting. Overweight individuals who, like most of us, were eating more than 14 hours a day were instructed to stick to a consistent 10 to 12 hour feeding window of their own choosing. On average they were able to successfully reduce their daily eating duration by about 4.5 hours, and within 16 weeks they had lost seven pounds. They also reported feeling more energetic and sleeping better. This may help explain why all participants voluntarily expressed their interest in continuing the time- restricted feeding on their own even after the study ended. You don’t often see that after weight loss studies. Even more remarkably, eight months later they retained their weight loss and improved energy and sleep. At the one-year point, maintained their boosted energy and sleep and kept the weight off, all from one of the simplest of interventions: Just telling people to stick to a consistent 10 to 12 hour feeding window of their own choosing. How did it work? Even though they weren’t told to change nutrition quality or quantity, they appeared to unintentionally eat hundreds of fewer calories a day. With self-selected time frames you wouldn’t necessarily think to expect circadian benefits, but because subjects were asked to keep the eating window consistent throughout the week “metabolic jetlag could be minimized.” The thinking is that because people tend to start their days later on weekends that’s disrupting their circadian rhythm, and indeed it is like they flew a few time zones west on Friday evening and flew back east on Monday morning; so, some of the metabolic advantage may have been due to maintaining a more regular eating schedule. Early or mid-day time-restricted feeding may have other benefits as well. Prolonged nightly fasting with reduced evening food intake has been associated with lower levels of inflammation and better blood sugar control, both of which might be expected to lower the risk of diseases such as breast cancer. So, data was collected on thousands of breast cancer survivors to see if nightly fasting duration made a difference. Those who couldn’t go more than 13 hours every night without eating had a 36 percent higher risk of cancer recurrence. These findings have led to the suggestion that efforts to “avoid eating after 8 pm and fast for 13 hours or more overnight may be a beneficial consideration for those patients looking to decrease cancer risk and recurrence,” though we’d need a randomized controlled trial to know for sure. Early time-restricted feeding may even play a role in the health of perhaps the longest living population in the world, the Seventh-Day Adventist Blue Zone in California. Slim, vegetarian, nut-eating, exercising, non-smoking Adventists live about a decade longer than the general population. Their greater life expectancy has been ascribed to these healthy lifestyle behaviors, but there’s one lesser known component that also may be playing a role. Historically, eating two large meals a day, breakfast and lunch, with a prolonged overnight fast was a part of Adventist teachings. Today, only about 1 in 10 Adventists surveyed were eating just two meals a day, but most, over 60 percent, reported breakfast or lunch was their largest meal of the day. Though this has yet to be studied with respect to longevity, frontloading one’s calories earlier in the day with a prolonged nightly fast has been associated with significant weight loss over time, leading the researchers to conclude that eating breakfast and lunch five to six hours apart and making the overnight fast last 18 to 19 hours may be a useful practical strategy for weight control.

The latest dietary guidelines – 2015 guidelines won\'t be out until probably January 2016 – have a  chapter on food components to reduce. But when they say things like reduce intake of solid fats (major sources of saturated and trans fatty acids), what does that mean in terms of which foods to reduce? Similarly, there\'s a chapter on nutrients we should increase our intake of, so-called shortfall nutrients. But when they say we need more magnesium, for example, what does that mean in terms of actual food? Let\'s look at 20 different types of foods to see, based on the federal guideline criteria, which foods are the healthiest, and which foods are the least healthy. To illustrate, I\'ll use traffic light labeling, like the UK signpost system which assigns colors for like green meaning go, yellow or amber meaning caution, and red meaning stop and think before you put it in your mouth. Added sugars is easy. Anyone could have guessed sweets and soda, but there\'s often surprising levels even in savory snack foods, like Ritz crackers, which I\'m using as my snack example. The top five offenders are basically soda, doughnuts, Kool-Aid, ice cream, and candy. Next is caloric density, calories per serving, where oils join dessert and processed snack foods as the worst, though one cannot consider eggs, fish, nuts and seeds, poultry, other meat or soda to be low-calorie foods. The top five sources of calories in the American diet are basically desserts, bread, chicken, soda and pizza. Can you guess where cholesterol is found? Desserts, dairy, eggs, fish, chicken, and other meat. #1 by far is eggs, but then chicken contributes more cholesterol to the American diet than beef, then cheese and pork. Here are the foods high in saturated fat, coming from dairy, dairy, doughnuts, dairy, chicken. Salt levels highest in lunch meat and snack foods, but Americans get most of their sodium from bread, chicken and pizza. About half of our food groups here have trans fats either naturally or artificially added or created. Cakes, cookies, crackers, pies and doughnuts number one, then animal products, margarine, French fries, chips, and microwave popcorn. Now to the nutrients. Green is a high source, pale green is a medium source, and white a poor source for calcium, fiber, magnesium, potassium, vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin K. OK, I know that was a little fast. Let\'s put it all together. OK, now this is nutrients per typically 100 grams, about three and a half ounces, but that\'s not how our body keeps track of what we eat. The body\'s food currency is in calories, not grams. Our body monitors how much energy we eat, not how much weight we eat, weight of food. We only have about 2,000 calories in the calorie bank to spend every day, so to maximize our nutrient purchase, we want to eat the most nutrient-dense foods. So I just changed this from nutrients per weight to nutrients per calories. The foods are just listed here in alphabetical order to look for trends so we can kind of rank them based on these scores from best to worst. So the foods to emphasize in one\'s diet are unprocessed, unrefined, plant-based foods, which in general lack the disease-promoting components and, as the Dietary Guidelines Committee put it, these foods contain not only the essential vitamins and minerals, but also hundreds of naturally occurring phytonutrients that may protect against cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis, and other chronic health conditions. So this chart actually extends far to the right, hundreds of additional bright green columns capturing all the phytonutrients found in whole plant foods, but largely missing from processed and animal derived foods. There would just be hundreds more white columns here in the middle with a few green tiles far off at the end. And the lack of disease- preventing compounds may be compounded by the presence of disease-promoting compounds. So that\'s why people eating more plant-based tend to end up eating a more nutrient-dense dietary pattern, closer to the current federal dietary guidelines. And the more plant-based we get, apparently, the better.')]","To help mitigate jet lag while flying across time zones, Nia should consider consuming foods that can help regulate her sleep and circadian rhythms. Here are some recommendations based on Dr. Greger’s insights:

1. **Pistachios**: These nuts are rich in melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep cycles. Consuming a small amount of pistachios can provide a physiological dose of melatonin, which may help adjust Nia’s internal clock to a new time zone.

2. **Tart Cherries**: Like pistachios, tart cherries are a natural source of melatonin. Drinking tart cherry juice or consuming whole tart cherries can help increase melatonin levels, potentially improving sleep quality and adjusting sleep patterns.

3. **Kiwifruit**: Studies have shown that consuming kiwifruit before bedtime can improve sleep onset, duration, and efficiency in adults. Including kiwifruit in her diet might help Nia sleep better after arriving in a new time zone.

4. **Cranberries**: Another fruit that is high in melatonin. Consuming cranberries or cranberry products could help regulate sleep cycles.

5. **Balanced Meals**: Eating well-balanced meals that include a variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy proteins can support overall health, including better sleep and energy levels, which are important when dealing with jet lag.

6. **Hydration**: Staying hydrated is crucial while flying, as dehydration can exacerbate the symptoms of jet lag. Water is the best choice, but hydrating foods like cucumbers, strawberries, and watermelon can also contribute to overall fluid intake.

7. **Avoid Caffeine and Alcohol**: These substances can interfere with sleep quality and further disrupt the sleep-wake cycle when traveling across time zones.

By incorporating these foods and practices into her travel routine, Nia can help reduce the effects of jet lag and adjust more quickly to new time zones.","To help mitigate jet lag while flying across time zones, Nia should consider consuming foods that can help regulate her sleep and circadian rhythms.

We saw from the kiwifruit study  that this seemed possible,  but the mechanism they  suggested for the effect— the serotonin levels in kiwifruit,  doesn\'t make any sense,  since serotonin can\'t cross  the blood-brain barrier.  So you can eat all  the serotonin you want  and it shouldn\'t affect  your brain chemistry. A different brain chemical,  though, melatonin,  can get from our  gut to our brain. Melatonin is a hormone  secreted at night  to help regulate our  circadian rhythms  by the pineal gland in  the center of our brain.  Supplements of the stuff are used  to prevent and reduce jet lag and about 20 years ago  MIT got the patent  to use melatonin to  help people sleep.  Melatonin is not only produced  in the pineal gland, though,  but also is naturally  present in edible plants. That might explain the  results of this study,  the Effects of a Tart Cherry Juice Beverage  on the Sleep of Older Adults with Insomnia. The research group had been  doing an earlier study  on tart cherry juice  as a sports recovery drink.  See, there\'s a  phytonutrient in cherries  with anti-inflammatory effects  on par with drugs like  aspirin, ibuprofen,  so they were trying to  see if they could help  reduce muscle soreness  after exercise  and some of the participants  in the study  just anecdotally said that they were sleeping better  on the cherries. That was unexpected.  But the researchers  realized that  cherries are a plant food  source of melatonin,  so they put it  to the test.  The reason they chose  older subjects is that  melatonin production tends  to drop as we age,  which may be  one reason why  there\'s higher insomnia  rates in the elderly.  So, they took a group of  older men and women suffering from  chronic insomnia  and put half on cherries  and half on placebo.  Now they couldn\'t use whole  cherries for the study,  because how could  you fool people with a fake placebo cherry?  So they used cherry juice  versus ""cherry Koolaid,""  and found significant but  modest improvements in sleep,  so for example fell to  sleep a few minutes faster,  and had 17 fewer minutes of  waking after sleep onset,  meaning, waking up in  the middle of the night.  So it was no  insomnia cure,  but it helped without  side effects. How do we know it was  the melatonin, though?  They repeated the study,  this time measuring  the melatonin levels  and indeed saw a boost in  circulating melatonin levels after the cherry juice,  but not after the koolaid. Similar results were found  in people eating  the actual cherries— 7 different varieties,  boosting melatonin levels  and actual sleep times.  The effects of all the other  phytonutrients in cherries  can\'t be precluded,  maybe they helped too, but if it is the melatonin,  there are more potent  sources than cherries. Orange bell peppers  have a bit,  an ounce of walnuts.  A tablespoon  of flaxseeds  has about as much  as a tomato,  all less than the tart  cherries that were tested,  but people may eat a lot more  tomatoes than cherries,  especially tart cherries.  Sweet cherries have 50 times  less melatonin than tart  and dried cherries  appear to have none.  In fact, the melatonin  content of tomatoes  was suggested as  one of the reasons traditional Mediterranean  diets were so healthy.  A few spices are  pretty potent,  just a teaspoon of fenugreek  seeds or mustard seeds  has about as much  as a few tomatoes, but the bronze, silver,  and gold go to  almonds, raspberries, and  goji berries off the charts. Now even gojis just have  15 micrograms an ounce,  but melatonin is potent stuff.  You inject just  10 into people  and you can boost their blood  levels 50 fold in 5 minutes.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

After literally hundreds of  studies we still don\'t know  the best answer to  either question. A few years ago I featured a large  hundred thousand-person study suggesting that ""Both short  and long sleep duration""  ""were associated with  increased mortality""  with people getting around  7 hours of sleep living longest. Since then a meta-analysis  of all such studies  including more than a  million people was published,  and they found  the same thing.  We still don\'t know, though,  if sleep duration is a cause,  or simply a marker  of ill health. Maybe sleeping too  little or too long  does make you unhealthy, or maybe we see the associated  lifespan shortening  because being unhealthy causes you  to sleep shorter or longer. Similar work has now been published  on cognitive function.  After controlling for  a long list of factors,  men and women in their 50s  and 60s getting 7 or 8 hours  appeared to have the  best short-term memory,  compared to those that  got much more or much less.  Same thing was just demonstrated  with immune function:  ""both reduced and prolonged  habitual sleep durations""  ""were associated with an  increased risk of pneumonia"". It\'s easy to prevent over  sleeping-- set an alarm.  But what if your problem  is not getting enough?  What if you\'re the 1 in  3 adults that suffers  symptoms of insomnia?  Sure there are drugs like  valium you can take for insomnia in  the short term, but they have a number  of adverse side effects  and non-pharmacological approaches such as cognitive behavioral  therapy are often difficult,  time-consuming, and  don\'t always work.  Wouldn\'t it be great to  have ""natural treatments  ""that can improve both sleep  onset and help patients""  ""improve the quality of  sleep while improving""  ""next-day symptoms  over the long term""?  The ""Effect of kiwifruit consumption on  sleep quality in adults with sleep problems.""  Two kiwi fruit an hour before  bed every night for four weeks.  Why study kiwifruits?  Well, people with sleep  disorders tend to have high levels of oxidative stress  so maybe antioxidant  rich foods may help,  but all fruits and vegetables  have antioxidants.  Ah, but kiwifruits contain twice  the serotonin of tomatoes,  but it really shouldn\'t cross  the blood/brain barrier.  Kiwifruit has folate,  and a deficiency might cause insomnia,  but there\'s lots more folate  in some other plant foods.  The reason they studied  kiwifruits is because they got grant money  from a kiwifruit company,  and I\'m glad they did  because they found  some really remarkable results:  significantly improved sleep onset,  duration, and efficiency  using both subjective and  objective measurements.

For these reasons,  melatonin supplements cannot be recommended. Too bad there’s no way you can get the benefits without the risks— unless, melatonin was  somehow found naturally in certain foods you could eat. Melatonin was first discovered in plants in 1995 and has since been found throughout the plant kingdom. But, enough that eating them actually affects your levels? Yes. You randomize people to eat more or fewer vegetables, and you can see the effect. Hard to get people to  eat vegetables though. How about beer? The melatonin present in beer contributes to an increase in the levels of melatonin in the human bloodstream. Though, alcohol consumption  may actually mess with your own endogenous melatonin secretion; so, beer probably isn’t the best choice. Eat two bananas, or drink the juice of about 2 pounds of  oranges or pineapple, and you can get significant bumps in melatonin concentrations in your blood, and the melatonin levels found in those fruits are pretty modest, compared to some other foods. Here’s the breakdown. The single food within each category with the highest recorded melatonin level, and how much you’d have to eat at one time to reach a physiological dose in your bloodstream. We make melatonin; so, it should come as no surprise that other animals do too. The most melatonin-rich meat tested was salmon, but because there were only billionths of a gram per serving, you’d have to sit down and eat about 200 pounds to get the effect. OK. So, forget meat. What about whole grains? The highest recorded was a strain of corn so rich in melatonin you’d only have to eat 16 ears of corn. All right, scratch that. What about other vegetables? Plain white button mushrooms  top the list. Only two pounds. A hundred times more  melatonin than meat, but still, they’re so light, 2 pounds is like eating 10 cups of mushrooms. That’s a lot in one sitting. Thankfully, cranberries to the rescue, the most melatonin-rich fruit. Just a single ounce, and it’s like you just took a melatonin supplement, with only good side effects, other than, of course, the extreme sourness. That’s about a third of a cup of cranberries. They’re pretty sturdy; so, you could travel without them getting smooshed, but what do you do with them once you get there. Easy to blend into a smoothie, but what if you’re stuck in a hotel? Can you eat dried cranberries, like what are they called—craisins? A study of various tart cherry products suggests that the drying process wipes out the melatonin; so, no melatonin in dried cherries and presumably dried cranberries either, nor in juice. The level of melatonin in cherry juice concentrate was almost nondetectable; so, drinking cranberry juice would also presumably be a wash, which brings us to nuts. Pistachios are not just the most melatonin-rich nut, they are simply off-the-charts as the most melatonin-rich food ever recorded. To get a physiological dose of melatonin, all you have to eat is two. Two what? Just two pistachios. Check it out; here are the data. More than 200 micrograms of melatonin per gram, point two milligrams per gram. And, you can get the normal daily spike your brain gives you by taking just 0.3 micrograms: so, just two nuts. So, taking a whole handful of pistachio nuts is like taking one of those high dose melatonin supplements. So, the best food for jet lag appears to be appropriately  timed pistachios.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Taking less than just 18 Ambien-class sleeping pills in an entire year may triple the risk of dying prematurely.\n\nIs Six Hours of Sleep Enough?

Even if that was all due to the difference in sleep, that\'s still only 6 pounds for 10,000+ more hours of sleep. If even a tiny fraction of that time was spent on diet and exercise, you know, biking to the nearest farm stand, more weight could have been lost in 16 weeks than in those 16 years. Every little bit helps, though, and getting at least seven hours is healthier for you anyway. This biggest reason to lose sleep over losing sleep is motor vehicle accident risk. Driving drowsy increases your risk of killing yourself and others. People might think twice about getting behind the wheel after staying awake for 48 hours straight, but even just two weeks of sleeping 6 hours a night impairs your cognitive performance as much as pulling two all-nighters in a row. So, what\'s the best way to sleep better? Sleeping pills are a nonstarter. Those prescribed even less than 18 pills a year of so-called hypnotics, the class of sleeping pills that includes Ambien, appear to have triple the risk of dying prematurely. Since up to 10% of the adult population is prescribed these drugs, if the drugs really are killing people, that could mean a six-figure death toll every year. Ambien\'s manufacturer questioned the study, but that\'s just one of dozens of studies that found a significant association between sleeping pills and premature death. When the principal investigator at the Scripps Clinic Sleep Center was criticized for reporting alarmingly high death risks from these commonly used medications, he replied: ""We can\'t hide risks, even if they might frighten patients out of taking hypnotics. Patients have a right to know."" What\'s more, non-pharmacological methods have been found to work as good or better than the drugs. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is what\'s called ""cognitive behavioral therapy, "" which combines conditioning techniques to re-associate the bed with sleep and education surrounding optimal sleep hygiene. Here are the four rules of sleep conditioning. (1) Go to bed only when you\'re sleepy. (2) Only use the bed for sleep (and sex). No reading, eating, or screen time. (3) If you can\'t fall asleep within about 15-20 minutes, get up, leave the bedroom, and don\'t come back until you\'re sleepy again. And repeat as necessary. And finally (4), get up at the same time every morning, no matter how little sleep you get. And although avoiding napping is often added, contrary to expectations, the majority of research does not show that daytime naps interfere with nighttime sleep. If there were four rules of sleep hygiene I\'d pick out, it would be (1): exercise regularly. The best time to exercise to improve sleep appears to be 4 to 8 hours before bedtime, though it appears to be a myth that exercising right before bed is somehow disruptive to sleep. (2) Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bedtime. We used to think as long as you don\'t drink caffeine in the evening, it wouldn\'t affect sleep, but four cups of coffee worth even six hours before bedtime can reduce total sleep time by more than an hour. Even just two cups in the morning at 7 a.m. can change what your brainwaves look like on EEG that night, though it\'s not clear if this has any clinical relevance beyond delaying the onset of sleep by an average of 10 minutes. Late afternoon alcohol consumption (6 hours before bedtime) may also impair sleep, even after it\'s cleared out of your system. And nicotine, whether from gum, pill, patch, or cigarette, can also have negative sleep effects, though so too can active nicotine withdrawal. Food-wise, low fiber intakes and high saturated fat and sugar intake is associated with lighter, less restorative sleep. Meat intake is associated with napping, suggested as a proxy for sleepiness. This may be one of the reasons insomnia has been reported as a side-effect of low carb, ketogenic diets. Supplement-wise, a single megadose of vitamin D was found to improve sleep duration and quality in men and women ages 20 through 50 with sleeping disorders. And I\'ve already talked about melatonin-rich foods and supplements in previous videos. (3) Make the bedroom quiet, dark, cool, and comfortable. Nocturnal noise can adversely impact sleep even if we\'re not consciously aware of it. Within a few days, you can become habituated to noises such that they don\'t wake you up, but EEG studies and subjective sleep surveys show the quality of your sleep can still be affected. Thankfully, ear plugs and sound masking, like white noise machines, have been shown to help. And finally (4), establish a relaxing bedtime routine. Relaxation techniques such as massage, mindfulness meditation, and soothing music may also help. So may taking a relaxing hot bath or shower. One of the reasons late-night eating can delay sleep is that it may interfere with the drop in core body temperature that normally occurs about bedtime. That\'s thought to be one of the cues that it\'s time for bed. So, should you not take a hot bath before bed? No, because as soon as you step out of the bath or shower, the rapid decline in skin temperature can accentuate the natural nighttime drop and improve sleep. Even just a warm foot bath may help you fall asleep about 15 minutes faster.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Did you know you can gain weight if you don’t get enough sleep?

Maybe high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. Well, there’s nothing I like better than bringing you the information that will help you do just that. Welcome to the Nutrition Facts Podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Michael Greger. Today, we discover the health benefits of sleep. And we start with the connection between the lack of sleep and weight gain. Population studies have found short sleep duration has been associated with obesity in both children and adults. Observational studies can never prove cause-and-effect, though. Maybe the obesity is leading to sleep loss instead of the other way around. Obesity can cause arthritis, acid reflux, and apnea, all of which can interfere with sleep. The relationship between obesity and sleep apnea, where your breathing repeatedly stops and starts throughout the night, may be explained by increased tongue fat—fat deposited inside the base of the tongue— that may contribute to obstructing your airway when you sleep on your back. The reverse causation explanation of the link between obesity and inadequate sleep is bolstered by the finding that weight loss interventions can improve daytime sleepiness. Potential confounding factors also abound. For example, people with lower socioeconomic status often work less desirable hours such as rotating or overnight shifts, or may live in noisier neighborhoods with poorer air quality, more crime. The link between inadequate sleep and obesity persists after controlling for these kinds of factors, but you can’t control for everything. You can’t know for sure if sleep deprivation leads to weight gain until you,...put it to the test. Have people pull an all-nighter and they get hungrier and choose larger portions. Randomize people to shave even just a few hours of sleep off every night and they start eating an average of 677 calories more a day compared to the normal sleep control group. Although individual responses vary widely, anywhere from eating 813 calories less per day to as many as 1,437 calories more, on average, studies found sleep deprivation led people to overeat by about 180 to 560 calories a day. Restrict people’s sleep and they also start craving unhealthier choices– more snacks, more foods that are fatty and sugary. Stick people in a brain scanner after staying awake all night, or after few nights of four-hour sleep, and their reward pathways light up brighter in response to high calorie foods. Sleep deprivation bumps the levels of the chief endocannabinoid in the body, the natural chemical we synthesize that binds to the same receptors as the active ingredient in marijuana. This may help explain the nighttime nibbling. On the calories outside of the equation, some short sleepers may take the extra time to exercise; others will be so sleepy they exercise less. The extra wakefulness may raise calorie expenditure up to about 100 calories a day, but if sleep-deprived individuals are overeating hundreds of calories, over time sleep deprivation may end up putting the “wide” in wide awake. With insufficient sleep inadvertently leading to such higher calorie intake, it’s no surprise that 4 out of 5 studies involving as few as 2–5 nights of sleep restriction found an increase in body weight. In other words, if you sleep less, you may gain more OK, but here’s where it gets crazy. Even if you control calorie intake, you still lose more fat when you get more sleep. Overweight subjects who normally got between 6.5 to 8.5 hours of sleep a night were randomized to two weeks of either 8.5 hours of sleep a night or 5.5 hours of sleep on the same calorie- controlled diet. Then the groups switched and spent another two weeks on the opposite regimen. So they spent a month living in the lab so their diets and sleep could be totally controlled and monitored. Just looking at the scales, sleep duration didn’t seem to matter, during both periods they ate the same number of calories and lost the same amount of weight, but most of the weight lost while getting 8.5 hours was fat, whereas most of the weight lost when only getting 5.5 hours of sleep a night was lean body mass. Same diet, but with more sleep they ended up losing more than twice as much body fat. So you snooze you lose… fat! In our next story, we discover how getting just one more hour of sleep a night may help with weight control. I featured a study that found that curtailing sleep can cut your rate of body fat loss in half, while exacerbating the loss of lean mass. To get better insight into what was going on, researchers took fat and muscle biopsies from people after a night of sleep loss. In terms of genes that were turned on and off, molecular signatures were discovered suggesting muscle breakdown and fat buildup. That was after an all-nighter, though, and in the weight-loss study the sleep-restricted groups ended up getting little more than 5 hours a night. What about a more realistic scenario like sleeping just like one hour less a night? Overweight adults were randomized to 8 weeks of a calorie restricted diet or the same diet combined with just 5 days a week of one hour a night less sleep. The sleep restricted group achieved the one hour a day less sleep on weekdays but ended up sleeping an hour more on the weekend days. So overall, they just cut about 3 hours of sleep out of their week. Would just those few hours a week make any weight loss difference? On the scale, no, but in the normal sleep group, 80% of the weight loss was fat, whereas in the group just missing a few hours of sleep a week it was the opposite— 80% of the loss was lean. This shows that a few hours of “catch up sleep” on the weekends is insufficient, and may in fact be contributing to the problem based on “social jetlag” effect I explored in a previous video. A comparable study was designed for kids, but the sleeping periods only lasted a week. Eight- to eleven-year olds were randomized to either increase or decrease their time in bed by 1.5 hours per night for a week and then switch the following week. They ate an average of 134 calories more on the days they slept less and gained in that week about half a pound compared to the sleep-more week. The question then becomes would sleeping more facilitate weight loss? When it comes to body fat, can we just, sleep it off? The benefit of interventional studies is that you can demonstrate cause and effect, but observational studies can allow you to more easily track people and their behaviors over a longer time span. For example, researchers followed a group of mostly overweight individuals who started out to averaging less than six hours of sleep a night for more than five years. During that time, about half maintained that schedule but the other half increased their sleep duration up to seven or eight hours a night and ended up gaining 5 pounds less fat. A study entitled “Sleeping habits predict the magnitude of fat loss” (among those cutting calories) found that every extra hour of sleep at night was associated with an extra 1-and-a-half pounds of weight loss over a period of about 3 to 6 months. That’s not the same as randomizing people to extra sleep, though. Maybe they were sleeping more because they were exercising more and that’s the real reason they lost more weight? Getting people to bump their sleep from about 5.5 hours up to 7 can lead to an overall decrease in appetite within two weeks, particularly for sugary and salty foods. A four-week study getting habitually short sleepers to sleep about an extra hour a night led them to consume about two fewer spoonful’s worth of sugar a day compared to the control group but this didn’t translate into any changes in body composition. A twelve-week study, on the other hand, randomizing overweight and obese individuals to a weight loss intervention with or without a sleep component found that the sleep group lost weight significantly faster. A national cross-sectional survey suggested lower obesity rates among kids in households that regularly ate dinner together as a family, got adequate sleep, and limited screen times, and so Harvard researchers decided to try to... put those behaviors to the test. A six-month randomized trial to improve household routines for obesity prevention among young children resulted in a lower BMI. Normally it’s hard to tease out the effects of multi-component interventions, but in this case exhortations to limit overall TV watching didn’t work, and the families were already eating together 6 days a week and so that didn’t change much either. The only thing they were able to get the kids to significantly alter was their sleep, and so the improved weight outcomes may be attributed at least in part to the ¾ hour average increase in nightly sleep. Overall, most sleep improvement interventions tended to show improved weight loss. I was intrigued to look up the one study that didn’t. The nice thing about systematic reviews (as opposed to so-called “narrative” reviews) is that they exhaustively include mention of every study that meets some prespecified criteria. This keeps reviewers from cherry-picking, but it can also lead to the inclusion of some strange studies. In this case, a randomized controlled trial of didgeridoo playing, the indigenous Australian wind instrument. Those randomized to the didgeridoo to improve their sleep quality did not lose any weight, but they also failed to improve the quality of their sleep (or, likely, that of their neighbors). Did you know that lactucin, the hypnotic component of lettuce, is a natural dietary remedy for insomnia? Here’s the story. There is a perception that time spent asleep is time wasted, but it is widely recognized that inadequate sleep is associated with multiple acute and chronic conditions, and results in the increased risk of death and disease.

Force people to go one week with only six hours of sleep a night, and you can change expression of more than 700 genes. The most dire effect may be endothelial dysfunction. The endothelium is the thin layer of cells that covers the internal surface of blood vessels and is responsible for allowing our arteries to relax and dilate back open properly. Randomize people for about a week to get five rather than seven hours of sleep, and just that two-hour difference a night resulted in a significant impairment in artery function. Okay, but what do these numbers mean? How bad is a week of 5-hour nights? Sleep deprivation is no joke. The magnitude of impairment is similar to that reported in people who smoke, have diabetes, or have coronary artery disease. No wonder people who sleep less than seven hours a night may experience a 12% to 35% increased risk of premature death compared to those who get a full seven hours. Yet a significant proportion of the population may routinely get less than that. Sufficiently long, restful sleep sessions each night are said to be an indisputable cornerstone of good health. Okay, so what can we do about it? Those who have sleep apnea, a common consequence of obesity that interferes with sleep, benefit from the use of CPAP machines while they\'re losing the weight to treat the underlying cause, hopefully. But what if apnea isn\'t your problem? What if you just have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep? In my book How Not to Diet, I have a whole section on sleep enhancement, where I go through the Four Rules of Sleep Conditioning and the Four Rules of Sleep Hygiene. What if you follow those guidelines but still can\'t get to sleep? Any natural dietary remedies? I already have videos on using kiwifruit to fight insomnia, and tart cherries, too. Are there any vegetables that might help? Lactuca sativa is a plant that has been traditionally used in the treatment of insomnia. What is this exotic sounding leafy vegetable? Lettuce! Evidently lettuce extracts have been used from the time of the Roman Empire as agents with sedative and sleep-inducing properties. Lettuce actually does have a hypnotic substance in it called lactucin, which is what makes lettuce taste a little bitter. But you don\'t know if it actually works until you put it to the test. And it works...in toads. But it also works in rodents. Sleep in both mice and rats is enhanced by romaine lettuce. They used romaine since it has a higher lactucin content compared to other lettuces. Okay, but does it work in people? About 10 years ago, a study was published in which insomnia sufferers were randomized to receive lettuce seed oil, oil extracted from lettuce seeds. Within a week, about 70% of those in the lettuce seed oil group said their insomnia very much or much improved, compared to only 20% in the placebo control group. The researchers concluded that lettuce seed oil was found to be a useful, safe sleeping aid in geriatric patients suffering from sleeping difficulties. They chose to study older individuals because insomnia affects surprisingly 20 to 40% of older adults at least a few nights a month. You think that\'s bad. Sleep disturbances can plague as many as nearly 8 out of 10 women during pregnancy. Of course, there\'s lots of different sleeping pills, but they may endanger the fetus or mother. For example, doctors frequently prescribe Ambien for pregnant women who have trouble sleeping, but Ambien use is associated with a wide range of adverse pregnancy outcomes like low birth weight babies, premature birth, and cesarean section. And the use of valium during pregnancy has been linked to birth defects including limb deficiencies. There has to be a better way. What about trying lettuce? The lettuce oil study had a number of limitations. For example, it was only single-blind, meaning the researchers knew who was on the lettuce supplements and who was on placebo, which could have introduced some bias. But the researchers essentially said, ""Give us a break. Big pharma has billions to spend on research. No one wants to fund studies on lettuce."" Finally, we got a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, but this time on a whole food, not just a lettuce seed extract. Yeah, but how do you come up with a placebo lettuce? How are you going to hide who  gets lettuce and who doesn\'t? Well, you can\'t fit a head of lettuce into a capsule, but you can fit whole lettuce seeds. And here we go: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial on lettuce seeds for pregnancy-related insomnia. A hundred pregnant women with insomnia were randomized to receive capsules containing either a quarter teaspoon of ground lettuce seeds or a placebo for two weeks, and those on the lettuce seeds saw a significant improvement in a sleep quality index score compared to placebo with no reported side effects.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

But researchers at MIT dispelled those myths about a decade ago. Tryptophan is one amino acid among many found in proteins, and they all compete with one another for transport across the blood-brain barrier, into the brain. And, since tryptophan is present in most animal proteins in relatively small quantities, it gets muscled out of the way. If you eat plant foods, though, the carbohydrates cause a release of insulin, which causes your muscles to take up the non-tryptophan amino acids as fuel. And so, your tryptophan can be first in line for brain access. Animal foods can even make things worse: “When tryptophan is ingested as part of a protein meal, serum tryptophan levels rise, but brain tryptophan levels decline… due to the mechanism of transport used by tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier.” The tryptophan levels in those given a high-protein turkey, egg, cheese breakfast dropped, whereas in the waffle-OJ group, their tryptophan levels went up. This may actually explain the carbohydrate cravings one sees in PMS— your brain may be trying to get you to boost tryptophan levels to feel better. “Consumption of a carbohydrate-rich, protein-poor evening test meal during the premenstrual period improved depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, fatigue, alertness, and calmness scores [significantly] among patients with premenstrual syndrome.” “Because synthesis of brain serotonin, which is known to be involved in mood and appetite, increases after carbohydrate intake, premenstrual syndrome subjects may overconsume carbohydrates in an attempt to improve their dysphoric mood state.” Ideally, though, it would be more than just carbs— we’ll cover the ideal mixture in tomorrow’s video-of-the-day.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Sleep and weight loss: Even getting just one more hour of sleep a night may help with weight control.\n\nThis video was based on the sleep section in my book, How Not to Diet, which you can learn more about here (https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-diet/) (all proceeds go to charity), or check out my presentation based on the book: Evidence-Based Weight Loss (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-weight-loss-live-presentation/).\n\nIf you missed the previous video, see Does Lack of Sleep Cause You to Gain Weight?

In my last video, I featured a study that found that curtailing sleep can cut your rate of body fat loss in half, while exacerbating the loss of lean mass. To get better insight into what was going on, researchers took fat and muscle biopsies from people after a night of sleep loss. In terms of genes that were turned on and off, molecular signatures were discovered suggesting muscle breakdown and fat buildup. That was after an all-nighter, though, and in the weight-loss study the sleep-restricted groups ended up getting little more than 5 hours a night. What about a more realistic scenario like sleeping just like one hour less a night? Overweight adults were randomized to 8 weeks of a calorie restricted diet or the same diet combined with just 5 days a week of one hour a night less sleep. The sleep restricted group achieved the one hour a day less sleep on weekdays but ended up sleeping an hour more on the weekend days. So overall, they just cut about 3 hours of sleep out of their week. Would just those few hours a week make any weight loss difference? On the scale, no, but in the normal sleep group, 80% of the weight loss was fat, whereas in the group just missing a few hours of sleep a week it was the opposite— 80% of the loss was lean. This shows that a few hours of “catch up sleep” on the weekends is insufficient, and may in fact be contributing to the problem based on “social jetlag” effect I explored in a previous video. A comparable study was designed for kids, but the sleeping periods only lasted a week. Eight- to eleven-year olds were randomized to either increase or decrease their time in bed by 1.5 hours per night for a week and then switch the following week. They ate an average of 134 calories more on the days they slept less and gained in that week about half a pound compared to the sleep-more week. The question then becomes would sleeping more facilitate weight loss? When it comes to body fat, can we just, sleep it off? The benefit of interventional studies is that you can demonstrate cause and effect, but observational studies can allow you to more easily track people and their behaviors over a longer time span. For example, researchers followed a group of mostly overweight individuals who started out to averaging less than six hours of sleep a night for more than five years. During that time, about half maintained that schedule but the other half increased their sleep duration up to seven or eight hours a night and ended up gaining 5 pounds less fat. A study entitled “Sleeping habits predict the magnitude of fat loss” (among those cutting calories) found that every extra hour of sleep at night was associated with an extra 1-and-a-half pounds of weight loss over a period of about 3 to 6 months. That’s not the same as randomizing people to extra sleep, though. Maybe they were sleeping more because they were exercising more and that’s the real reason they lost more weight? Getting people to bump their sleep from about 5.5 hours up to 7 can lead to an overall decrease in appetite within two weeks, particularly for sugary and salty foods. A four-week study getting habitually short sleepers to sleep about an extra hour a night led them to consume about two fewer spoonful’s worth of sugar a day compared to the control group but this didn’t translate into any changes in body composition. A twelve-week study, on the other hand, randomizing overweight and obese individuals to a weight loss intervention with or without a sleep component found that the sleep group lost weight significantly faster. A national cross-sectional survey suggested lower obesity rates among kids in households that regularly ate dinner together as a family, got adequate sleep, and limited screen times, and so Harvard researchers decided to try to... put those behaviors to the test. A six-month randomized trial to improve household routines for obesity prevention among young children resulted in a lower BMI. Normally it’s hard to tease out the effects of multi-component interventions, but in this case exhortations to limit overall TV watching didn’t work, and the families were already eating together 6 days a week and so that didn’t change much either. The only thing they were able to get the kids to significantly alter was their sleep, and so the improved weight outcomes may be attributed at least in part to the ¾ hour average increase in nightly sleep. Overall, most sleep improvement interventions tended to show improved weight loss. I was intrigued to look up the one study that didn’t. The nice thing about systematic reviews (as opposed to so-called “narrative” reviews) is that they exhaustively include mention of every study that meets some prespecified criteria. This keeps reviewers from cherry-picking, but it can also lead to the inclusion of some strange studies. In this case, a randomized controlled trial of didgeridoo playing, the indigenous Australian wind instrument. Those randomized to the didgeridoo to improve their sleep quality did not lose any weight, but they also failed to improve the quality of their sleep (or, likely, that of their neighbors).'), Document(metadata={'description': 'The effects of spinach and berries on oxidative stress, inflammation, and muscle soreness in athletes.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

What about the consumption of fruit and vegetables and risk of frailty in the elderly? Higher fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with lower frailty as well, in a dose-response manner, meaning more fruit less frailty, and more vegetables too, but these were all observational studies, which can’t alone prove cause-and-effect. What happens when you  put foods to the test? Well, no positive influence ingesting chia seed oil on human running performance, but there was an effect found for spinach supplementation on exercise-induced oxidation stress. And by spinach supplementation, they meant they just gave some guys some fresh raw spinach leaves, one gram per kilo, so like a quarter of a bunch a day for two weeks and then they had them  run a half marathon. And, they found that “chronic daily oral supplementation of spinach,” uh meaning like eating a salad, has alleviating effects on known markers of oxidative stress and muscle damage, Here’s what happens when you run a half marathon without spinach: a big spike in oxidative stress, blood malondealdehyde levels, that stay up hours or even days later. In the spinach group, the before and after 2 weeks of spinach doesn’t seem to make much of a difference, but put the body under pressure, and then you can really see the difference. Your body is better able to deal with the stress. And, if you look at the resulting muscle damage, as measured by creatine kinase  leakage from your muscles (that\'s an enzyme that should  be in your muscles, not leaking out into your blood), you start out at about 100 and go up to 200 after the half marathon, right after, 2 hours later. But it’s the next day where you really feel it, that delayed onset muscle soreness, with CK levels reaching 600 before coming back down. Okay, that’s without spinach, though. On spinach, you get a similar immediate post-race bump, but it’s that next day where spinach really shines. You don’t get that same next-day spike, and so, for a competitive athlete, that quicker recovery may get you back training harder sooner. They attribute this to the anti- inflammatory effects of spinach. Same with black currant juice. After some hardcore weight lifting, muscle damage indicators  go up and stay up, whereas the same lifting drinking berries, and it goes up, but  comes right back down. But these were just measures of a biomarker of muscle soreness. What about actual soreness? If you look at the effects of tart cherry juice on recovery following prolonged, intermittent sprints in soccer players, you see the same kind of reduction in biomarkers of inflammation, but more importantly, less resulting muscle soreness. Here’s the soreness reported in the days afterwards in the placebo group. Only about half in the cherry group. Then, they measured maximum voluntary isometric contractions of the leg muscles, which understandably took a hit in the days after the intense workout, but not in the cherry group. They conclude that participants supplemented with a tart cherry concentrate were able to maintain greater  functional performance. But, that was testing like how high can you vertically jump. They didn’t actually see if they played soccer any better. But, this study on purple grape juice actually showed an ergogenic effect in recreational runners by promoting increased time to exhaustion, where you ramp people up on a treadmill and see how long they  can go before collapsing. After a month of drinking a grape Kool-Aid type placebo control drink, no real change in performance, but a whopping 15% improvement in the real grape group– hung on for another 12 minutes.

1. **Tart Cherries and Cherry Juice**: Tart cherries are a natural source of melatonin, a hormone that helps regulate sleep-wake cycles. Studies suggest that consuming tart cherry juice can enhance sleep quality and duration, particularly in older adults with insomnia. This effect is likely due to the melatonin content as well as the anti-inflammatory properties of cherries.

2. **Kiwifruit**: Consuming two kiwifruits an hour before bedtime may improve both sleep quality and duration. Kiwifruit contains serotonin and folate, which might contribute to its sleep-promoting effects, although the exact mechanism is not fully understood.

3. **Goji Berries (also known as Lycium berries)**: Goji berries are another potent source of melatonin. They can be consumed directly or in dried form and may help in boosting melatonin levels, thereby potentially improving sleep quality.

4. **Nuts, particularly Pistachios**: Pistachios stand out as they have high levels of melatonin. Consuming pistachios in moderation before bedtime might help in enhancing sleep quality due to their significant melatonin content.

5. **Almonds and Walnuts**: These nuts contain melatonin as well as essential minerals like magnesium and zinc that are known to aid sleep.

6. **Flaxseeds**: Flaxseeds are also a source of melatonin and can be included in the diet to potentially help with sleep.

7. **Other Berries and Fruits**: Like tart cherries, other berries (such as raspberries) and fruits are beneficial due to their antioxidant properties and potential melatonin content.

8. **Spinach**: Rich in magnesium, spinach can help in relaxing the muscles and the nervous system, thereby potentially aiding better sleep.

To potentially address the issue of waking up groggy, it's important to consider not only the duration but also the quality of sleep, which these foods might help improve by contributing to a more regulated sleep cycle and enhancing the depth of sleep. Additionally, maintaining good sleep hygiene and a regular sleep schedule is crucial in achieving restful sleep.","Based on the information provided, several foods have been identified that may help improve the quality and depth of sleep:

We saw from the kiwifruit study  that this seemed possible,  but the mechanism they  suggested for the effect— the serotonin levels in kiwifruit,  doesn\'t make any sense,  since serotonin can\'t cross  the blood-brain barrier.  So you can eat all  the serotonin you want  and it shouldn\'t affect  your brain chemistry. A different brain chemical,  though, melatonin,  can get from our  gut to our brain. Melatonin is a hormone  secreted at night  to help regulate our  circadian rhythms  by the pineal gland in  the center of our brain.  Supplements of the stuff are used  to prevent and reduce jet lag and about 20 years ago  MIT got the patent  to use melatonin to  help people sleep.  Melatonin is not only produced  in the pineal gland, though,  but also is naturally  present in edible plants. That might explain the  results of this study,  the Effects of a Tart Cherry Juice Beverage  on the Sleep of Older Adults with Insomnia. The research group had been  doing an earlier study  on tart cherry juice  as a sports recovery drink.  See, there\'s a  phytonutrient in cherries  with anti-inflammatory effects  on par with drugs like  aspirin, ibuprofen,  so they were trying to  see if they could help  reduce muscle soreness  after exercise  and some of the participants  in the study  just anecdotally said that they were sleeping better  on the cherries. That was unexpected.  But the researchers  realized that  cherries are a plant food  source of melatonin,  so they put it  to the test.  The reason they chose  older subjects is that  melatonin production tends  to drop as we age,  which may be  one reason why  there\'s higher insomnia  rates in the elderly.  So, they took a group of  older men and women suffering from  chronic insomnia  and put half on cherries  and half on placebo.  Now they couldn\'t use whole  cherries for the study,  because how could  you fool people with a fake placebo cherry?  So they used cherry juice  versus ""cherry Koolaid,""  and found significant but  modest improvements in sleep,  so for example fell to  sleep a few minutes faster,  and had 17 fewer minutes of  waking after sleep onset,  meaning, waking up in  the middle of the night.  So it was no  insomnia cure,  but it helped without  side effects. How do we know it was  the melatonin, though?  They repeated the study,  this time measuring  the melatonin levels  and indeed saw a boost in  circulating melatonin levels after the cherry juice,  but not after the koolaid. Similar results were found  in people eating  the actual cherries— 7 different varieties,  boosting melatonin levels  and actual sleep times.  The effects of all the other  phytonutrients in cherries  can\'t be precluded,  maybe they helped too, but if it is the melatonin,  there are more potent  sources than cherries. Orange bell peppers  have a bit,  an ounce of walnuts.  A tablespoon  of flaxseeds  has about as much  as a tomato,  all less than the tart  cherries that were tested,  but people may eat a lot more  tomatoes than cherries,  especially tart cherries.  Sweet cherries have 50 times  less melatonin than tart  and dried cherries  appear to have none.  In fact, the melatonin  content of tomatoes  was suggested as  one of the reasons traditional Mediterranean  diets were so healthy.  A few spices are  pretty potent,  just a teaspoon of fenugreek  seeds or mustard seeds  has about as much  as a few tomatoes, but the bronze, silver,  and gold go to  almonds, raspberries, and  goji berries off the charts.

After literally hundreds of  studies we still don\'t know  the best answer to  either question. A few years ago I featured a large  hundred thousand-person study suggesting that ""Both short  and long sleep duration""  ""were associated with  increased mortality""  with people getting around  7 hours of sleep living longest. Since then a meta-analysis  of all such studies  including more than a  million people was published,  and they found  the same thing.  We still don\'t know, though,  if sleep duration is a cause,  or simply a marker  of ill health. Maybe sleeping too  little or too long  does make you unhealthy, or maybe we see the associated  lifespan shortening  because being unhealthy causes you  to sleep shorter or longer. Similar work has now been published  on cognitive function.  After controlling for  a long list of factors,  men and women in their 50s  and 60s getting 7 or 8 hours  appeared to have the  best short-term memory,  compared to those that  got much more or much less.  Same thing was just demonstrated  with immune function:  ""both reduced and prolonged  habitual sleep durations""  ""were associated with an  increased risk of pneumonia"". It\'s easy to prevent over  sleeping-- set an alarm.  But what if your problem  is not getting enough?  What if you\'re the 1 in  3 adults that suffers  symptoms of insomnia?  Sure there are drugs like  valium you can take for insomnia in  the short term, but they have a number  of adverse side effects  and non-pharmacological approaches such as cognitive behavioral  therapy are often difficult,  time-consuming, and  don\'t always work.  Wouldn\'t it be great to  have ""natural treatments  ""that can improve both sleep  onset and help patients""  ""improve the quality of  sleep while improving""  ""next-day symptoms  over the long term""?  The ""Effect of kiwifruit consumption on  sleep quality in adults with sleep problems.""  Two kiwi fruit an hour before  bed every night for four weeks.  Why study kiwifruits?  Well, people with sleep  disorders tend to have high levels of oxidative stress  so maybe antioxidant  rich foods may help,  but all fruits and vegetables  have antioxidants.  Ah, but kiwifruits contain twice  the serotonin of tomatoes,  but it really shouldn\'t cross  the blood/brain barrier.  Kiwifruit has folate,  and a deficiency might cause insomnia,  but there\'s lots more folate  in some other plant foods.  The reason they studied  kiwifruits is because they got grant money  from a kiwifruit company,  and I\'m glad they did  because they found  some really remarkable results:  significantly improved sleep onset,  duration, and efficiency  using both subjective and  objective measurements.  Went from sleeping  6 hours a night to 7,  just eating a few kiwifruit.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'There may be a way to get the benefits of over-the-counter melatonin supplements without the risk.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

For these reasons,  melatonin supplements cannot be recommended. Too bad there’s no way you can get the benefits without the risks— unless, melatonin was  somehow found naturally in certain foods you could eat. Melatonin was first discovered in plants in 1995 and has since been found throughout the plant kingdom. But, enough that eating them actually affects your levels? Yes. You randomize people to eat more or fewer vegetables, and you can see the effect. Hard to get people to  eat vegetables though. How about beer? The melatonin present in beer contributes to an increase in the levels of melatonin in the human bloodstream. Though, alcohol consumption  may actually mess with your own endogenous melatonin secretion; so, beer probably isn’t the best choice. Eat two bananas, or drink the juice of about 2 pounds of  oranges or pineapple, and you can get significant bumps in melatonin concentrations in your blood, and the melatonin levels found in those fruits are pretty modest, compared to some other foods. Here’s the breakdown. The single food within each category with the highest recorded melatonin level, and how much you’d have to eat at one time to reach a physiological dose in your bloodstream. We make melatonin; so, it should come as no surprise that other animals do too. The most melatonin-rich meat tested was salmon, but because there were only billionths of a gram per serving, you’d have to sit down and eat about 200 pounds to get the effect. OK. So, forget meat. What about whole grains? The highest recorded was a strain of corn so rich in melatonin you’d only have to eat 16 ears of corn. All right, scratch that. What about other vegetables? Plain white button mushrooms  top the list. Only two pounds. A hundred times more  melatonin than meat, but still, they’re so light, 2 pounds is like eating 10 cups of mushrooms. That’s a lot in one sitting. Thankfully, cranberries to the rescue, the most melatonin-rich fruit. Just a single ounce, and it’s like you just took a melatonin supplement, with only good side effects, other than, of course, the extreme sourness. That’s about a third of a cup of cranberries. They’re pretty sturdy; so, you could travel without them getting smooshed, but what do you do with them once you get there. Easy to blend into a smoothie, but what if you’re stuck in a hotel? Can you eat dried cranberries, like what are they called—craisins? A study of various tart cherry products suggests that the drying process wipes out the melatonin; so, no melatonin in dried cherries and presumably dried cranberries either, nor in juice. The level of melatonin in cherry juice concentrate was almost nondetectable; so, drinking cranberry juice would also presumably be a wash, which brings us to nuts. Pistachios are not just the most melatonin-rich nut, they are simply off-the-charts as the most melatonin-rich food ever recorded. To get a physiological dose of melatonin, all you have to eat is two. Two what? Just two pistachios. Check it out; here are the data. More than 200 micrograms of melatonin per gram, point two milligrams per gram. And, you can get the normal daily spike your brain gives you by taking just 0.3 micrograms: so, just two nuts. So, taking a whole handful of pistachio nuts is like taking one of those high dose melatonin supplements. So, the best food for jet lag appears to be appropriately  timed pistachios.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Taking less than just 18 Ambien-class sleeping pills in an entire year may triple the risk of dying prematurely.\n\nIs Six Hours of Sleep Enough?

Even if that was all due to the difference in sleep, that\'s still only 6 pounds for 10,000+ more hours of sleep. If even a tiny fraction of that time was spent on diet and exercise, you know, biking to the nearest farm stand, more weight could have been lost in 16 weeks than in those 16 years. Every little bit helps, though, and getting at least seven hours is healthier for you anyway. This biggest reason to lose sleep over losing sleep is motor vehicle accident risk. Driving drowsy increases your risk of killing yourself and others. People might think twice about getting behind the wheel after staying awake for 48 hours straight, but even just two weeks of sleeping 6 hours a night impairs your cognitive performance as much as pulling two all-nighters in a row. So, what\'s the best way to sleep better? Sleeping pills are a nonstarter. Those prescribed even less than 18 pills a year of so-called hypnotics, the class of sleeping pills that includes Ambien, appear to have triple the risk of dying prematurely. Since up to 10% of the adult population is prescribed these drugs, if the drugs really are killing people, that could mean a six-figure death toll every year. Ambien\'s manufacturer questioned the study, but that\'s just one of dozens of studies that found a significant association between sleeping pills and premature death. When the principal investigator at the Scripps Clinic Sleep Center was criticized for reporting alarmingly high death risks from these commonly used medications, he replied: ""We can\'t hide risks, even if they might frighten patients out of taking hypnotics. Patients have a right to know."" What\'s more, non-pharmacological methods have been found to work as good or better than the drugs. The recommended first-line treatment for insomnia is what\'s called ""cognitive behavioral therapy, "" which combines conditioning techniques to re-associate the bed with sleep and education surrounding optimal sleep hygiene. Here are the four rules of sleep conditioning. (1) Go to bed only when you\'re sleepy. (2) Only use the bed for sleep (and sex). No reading, eating, or screen time. (3) If you can\'t fall asleep within about 15-20 minutes, get up, leave the bedroom, and don\'t come back until you\'re sleepy again. And repeat as necessary. And finally (4), get up at the same time every morning, no matter how little sleep you get. And although avoiding napping is often added, contrary to expectations, the majority of research does not show that daytime naps interfere with nighttime sleep. If there were four rules of sleep hygiene I\'d pick out, it would be (1): exercise regularly. The best time to exercise to improve sleep appears to be 4 to 8 hours before bedtime, though it appears to be a myth that exercising right before bed is somehow disruptive to sleep. (2) Avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol before bedtime. We used to think as long as you don\'t drink caffeine in the evening, it wouldn\'t affect sleep, but four cups of coffee worth even six hours before bedtime can reduce total sleep time by more than an hour. Even just two cups in the morning at 7 a.m. can change what your brainwaves look like on EEG that night, though it\'s not clear if this has any clinical relevance beyond delaying the onset of sleep by an average of 10 minutes. Late afternoon alcohol consumption (6 hours before bedtime) may also impair sleep, even after it\'s cleared out of your system. And nicotine, whether from gum, pill, patch, or cigarette, can also have negative sleep effects, though so too can active nicotine withdrawal. Food-wise, low fiber intakes and high saturated fat and sugar intake is associated with lighter, less restorative sleep. Meat intake is associated with napping, suggested as a proxy for sleepiness. This may be one of the reasons insomnia has been reported as a side-effect of low carb, ketogenic diets. Supplement-wise, a single megadose of vitamin D was found to improve sleep duration and quality in men and women ages 20 through 50 with sleeping disorders. And I\'ve already talked about melatonin-rich foods and supplements in previous videos. (3) Make the bedroom quiet, dark, cool, and comfortable. Nocturnal noise can adversely impact sleep even if we\'re not consciously aware of it. Within a few days, you can become habituated to noises such that they don\'t wake you up, but EEG studies and subjective sleep surveys show the quality of your sleep can still be affected. Thankfully, ear plugs and sound masking, like white noise machines, have been shown to help. And finally (4), establish a relaxing bedtime routine. Relaxation techniques such as massage, mindfulness meditation, and soothing music may also help. So may taking a relaxing hot bath or shower. One of the reasons late-night eating can delay sleep is that it may interfere with the drop in core body temperature that normally occurs about bedtime. That\'s thought to be one of the cues that it\'s time for bed. So, should you not take a hot bath before bed? No, because as soon as you step out of the bath or shower, the rapid decline in skin temperature can accentuate the natural nighttime drop and improve sleep. Even just a warm foot bath may help you fall asleep about 15 minutes faster.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Foods for insomnia.

Force people to go one week with only six hours of sleep a night, and you can change expression of more than 700 genes. The most dire effect may be endothelial dysfunction. The endothelium is the thin layer of cells that covers the internal surface of blood vessels and is responsible for allowing our arteries to relax and dilate back open properly. Randomize people for about a week to get five rather than seven hours of sleep, and just that two-hour difference a night resulted in a significant impairment in artery function. Okay, but what do these numbers mean? How bad is a week of 5-hour nights? Sleep deprivation is no joke. The magnitude of impairment is similar to that reported in people who smoke, have diabetes, or have coronary artery disease. No wonder people who sleep less than seven hours a night may experience a 12% to 35% increased risk of premature death compared to those who get a full seven hours. Yet a significant proportion of the population may routinely get less than that. Sufficiently long, restful sleep sessions each night are said to be an indisputable cornerstone of good health. Okay, so what can we do about it? Those who have sleep apnea, a common consequence of obesity that interferes with sleep, benefit from the use of CPAP machines while they\'re losing the weight to treat the underlying cause, hopefully. But what if apnea isn\'t your problem? What if you just have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep? In my book How Not to Diet, I have a whole section on sleep enhancement, where I go through the Four Rules of Sleep Conditioning and the Four Rules of Sleep Hygiene. What if you follow those guidelines but still can\'t get to sleep? Any natural dietary remedies? I already have videos on using kiwifruit to fight insomnia, and tart cherries, too. Are there any vegetables that might help? Lactuca sativa is a plant that has been traditionally used in the treatment of insomnia. What is this exotic sounding leafy vegetable? Lettuce! Evidently lettuce extracts have been used from the time of the Roman Empire as agents with sedative and sleep-inducing properties. Lettuce actually does have a hypnotic substance in it called lactucin, which is what makes lettuce taste a little bitter. But you don\'t know if it actually works until you put it to the test. And it works...in toads. But it also works in rodents. Sleep in both mice and rats is enhanced by romaine lettuce. They used romaine since it has a higher lactucin content compared to other lettuces. Okay, but does it work in people? About 10 years ago, a study was published in which insomnia sufferers were randomized to receive lettuce seed oil, oil extracted from lettuce seeds. Within a week, about 70% of those in the lettuce seed oil group said their insomnia very much or much improved, compared to only 20% in the placebo control group. The researchers concluded that lettuce seed oil was found to be a useful, safe sleeping aid in geriatric patients suffering from sleeping difficulties. They chose to study older individuals because insomnia affects surprisingly 20 to 40% of older adults at least a few nights a month. You think that\'s bad. Sleep disturbances can plague as many as nearly 8 out of 10 women during pregnancy. Of course, there\'s lots of different sleeping pills, but they may endanger the fetus or mother. For example, doctors frequently prescribe Ambien for pregnant women who have trouble sleeping, but Ambien use is associated with a wide range of adverse pregnancy outcomes like low birth weight babies, premature birth, and cesarean section. And the use of valium during pregnancy has been linked to birth defects including limb deficiencies. There has to be a better way. What about trying lettuce? The lettuce oil study had a number of limitations. For example, it was only single-blind, meaning the researchers knew who was on the lettuce supplements and who was on placebo, which could have introduced some bias. But the researchers essentially said, ""Give us a break. Big pharma has billions to spend on research. No one wants to fund studies on lettuce."" Finally, we got a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, but this time on a whole food, not just a lettuce seed extract. Yeah, but how do you come up with a placebo lettuce? How are you going to hide who  gets lettuce and who doesn\'t? Well, you can\'t fit a head of lettuce into a capsule, but you can fit whole lettuce seeds. And here we go: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial on lettuce seeds for pregnancy-related insomnia. A hundred pregnant women with insomnia were randomized to receive capsules containing either a quarter teaspoon of ground lettuce seeds or a placebo for two weeks, and those on the lettuce seeds saw a significant improvement in a sleep quality index score compared to placebo with no reported side effects.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Did you know you can gain weight if you don’t get enough sleep?

Maybe high blood pressure, diabetes, or heart disease. Well, there’s nothing I like better than bringing you the information that will help you do just that. Welcome to the Nutrition Facts Podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Michael Greger. Today, we discover the health benefits of sleep. And we start with the connection between the lack of sleep and weight gain. Population studies have found short sleep duration has been associated with obesity in both children and adults. Observational studies can never prove cause-and-effect, though. Maybe the obesity is leading to sleep loss instead of the other way around. Obesity can cause arthritis, acid reflux, and apnea, all of which can interfere with sleep. The relationship between obesity and sleep apnea, where your breathing repeatedly stops and starts throughout the night, may be explained by increased tongue fat—fat deposited inside the base of the tongue— that may contribute to obstructing your airway when you sleep on your back. The reverse causation explanation of the link between obesity and inadequate sleep is bolstered by the finding that weight loss interventions can improve daytime sleepiness. Potential confounding factors also abound. For example, people with lower socioeconomic status often work less desirable hours such as rotating or overnight shifts, or may live in noisier neighborhoods with poorer air quality, more crime. The link between inadequate sleep and obesity persists after controlling for these kinds of factors, but you can’t control for everything. You can’t know for sure if sleep deprivation leads to weight gain until you,...put it to the test. Have people pull an all-nighter and they get hungrier and choose larger portions. Randomize people to shave even just a few hours of sleep off every night and they start eating an average of 677 calories more a day compared to the normal sleep control group. Although individual responses vary widely, anywhere from eating 813 calories less per day to as many as 1,437 calories more, on average, studies found sleep deprivation led people to overeat by about 180 to 560 calories a day. Restrict people’s sleep and they also start craving unhealthier choices– more snacks, more foods that are fatty and sugary. Stick people in a brain scanner after staying awake all night, or after few nights of four-hour sleep, and their reward pathways light up brighter in response to high calorie foods. Sleep deprivation bumps the levels of the chief endocannabinoid in the body, the natural chemical we synthesize that binds to the same receptors as the active ingredient in marijuana. This may help explain the nighttime nibbling. On the calories outside of the equation, some short sleepers may take the extra time to exercise; others will be so sleepy they exercise less. The extra wakefulness may raise calorie expenditure up to about 100 calories a day, but if sleep-deprived individuals are overeating hundreds of calories, over time sleep deprivation may end up putting the “wide” in wide awake. With insufficient sleep inadvertently leading to such higher calorie intake, it’s no surprise that 4 out of 5 studies involving as few as 2–5 nights of sleep restriction found an increase in body weight. In other words, if you sleep less, you may gain more OK, but here’s where it gets crazy. Even if you control calorie intake, you still lose more fat when you get more sleep. Overweight subjects who normally got between 6.5 to 8.5 hours of sleep a night were randomized to two weeks of either 8.5 hours of sleep a night or 5.5 hours of sleep on the same calorie- controlled diet. Then the groups switched and spent another two weeks on the opposite regimen. So they spent a month living in the lab so their diets and sleep could be totally controlled and monitored. Just looking at the scales, sleep duration didn’t seem to matter, during both periods they ate the same number of calories and lost the same amount of weight, but most of the weight lost while getting 8.5 hours was fat, whereas most of the weight lost when only getting 5.5 hours of sleep a night was lean body mass. Same diet, but with more sleep they ended up losing more than twice as much body fat. So you snooze you lose… fat! In our next story, we discover how getting just one more hour of sleep a night may help with weight control. I featured a study that found that curtailing sleep can cut your rate of body fat loss in half, while exacerbating the loss of lean mass. To get better insight into what was going on, researchers took fat and muscle biopsies from people after a night of sleep loss. In terms of genes that were turned on and off, molecular signatures were discovered suggesting muscle breakdown and fat buildup. That was after an all-nighter, though, and in the weight-loss study the sleep-restricted groups ended up getting little more than 5 hours a night. What about a more realistic scenario like sleeping just like one hour less a night? Overweight adults were randomized to 8 weeks of a calorie restricted diet or the same diet combined with just 5 days a week of one hour a night less sleep. The sleep restricted group achieved the one hour a day less sleep on weekdays but ended up sleeping an hour more on the weekend days. So overall, they just cut about 3 hours of sleep out of their week. Would just those few hours a week make any weight loss difference? On the scale, no, but in the normal sleep group, 80% of the weight loss was fat, whereas in the group just missing a few hours of sleep a week it was the opposite— 80% of the loss was lean. This shows that a few hours of “catch up sleep” on the weekends is insufficient, and may in fact be contributing to the problem based on “social jetlag” effect I explored in a previous video. A comparable study was designed for kids, but the sleeping periods only lasted a week. Eight- to eleven-year olds were randomized to either increase or decrease their time in bed by 1.5 hours per night for a week and then switch the following week. They ate an average of 134 calories more on the days they slept less and gained in that week about half a pound compared to the sleep-more week. The question then becomes would sleeping more facilitate weight loss? When it comes to body fat, can we just, sleep it off? The benefit of interventional studies is that you can demonstrate cause and effect, but observational studies can allow you to more easily track people and their behaviors over a longer time span. For example, researchers followed a group of mostly overweight individuals who started out to averaging less than six hours of sleep a night for more than five years. During that time, about half maintained that schedule but the other half increased their sleep duration up to seven or eight hours a night and ended up gaining 5 pounds less fat. A study entitled “Sleeping habits predict the magnitude of fat loss” (among those cutting calories) found that every extra hour of sleep at night was associated with an extra 1-and-a-half pounds of weight loss over a period of about 3 to 6 months. That’s not the same as randomizing people to extra sleep, though. Maybe they were sleeping more because they were exercising more and that’s the real reason they lost more weight? Getting people to bump their sleep from about 5.5 hours up to 7 can lead to an overall decrease in appetite within two weeks, particularly for sugary and salty foods. A four-week study getting habitually short sleepers to sleep about an extra hour a night led them to consume about two fewer spoonful’s worth of sugar a day compared to the control group but this didn’t translate into any changes in body composition. A twelve-week study, on the other hand, randomizing overweight and obese individuals to a weight loss intervention with or without a sleep component found that the sleep group lost weight significantly faster. A national cross-sectional survey suggested lower obesity rates among kids in households that regularly ate dinner together as a family, got adequate sleep, and limited screen times, and so Harvard researchers decided to try to... put those behaviors to the test. A six-month randomized trial to improve household routines for obesity prevention among young children resulted in a lower BMI. Normally it’s hard to tease out the effects of multi-component interventions, but in this case exhortations to limit overall TV watching didn’t work, and the families were already eating together 6 days a week and so that didn’t change much either. The only thing they were able to get the kids to significantly alter was their sleep, and so the improved weight outcomes may be attributed at least in part to the ¾ hour average increase in nightly sleep. Overall, most sleep improvement interventions tended to show improved weight loss. I was intrigued to look up the one study that didn’t. The nice thing about systematic reviews (as opposed to so-called “narrative” reviews) is that they exhaustively include mention of every study that meets some prespecified criteria. This keeps reviewers from cherry-picking, but it can also lead to the inclusion of some strange studies. In this case, a randomized controlled trial of didgeridoo playing, the indigenous Australian wind instrument. Those randomized to the didgeridoo to improve their sleep quality did not lose any weight, but they also failed to improve the quality of their sleep (or, likely, that of their neighbors). Did you know that lactucin, the hypnotic component of lettuce, is a natural dietary remedy for insomnia? Here’s the story. There is a perception that time spent asleep is time wasted, but it is widely recognized that inadequate sleep is associated with multiple acute and chronic conditions, and results in the increased risk of death and disease.

The most dire effect may be endothelial dysfunction. The endothelium is the thin layer of cells that covers the internal surface of blood vessels and is responsible for allowing our arteries to relax and dilate back open properly. Randomize people for about a week to get five rather than seven hours of sleep, and just that two-hour difference a night resulted in a significant impairment in artery function. Okay, but what do these numbers mean? How bad is a week of 5-hour nights? Sleep deprivation is no joke. The magnitude of impairment is similar to that reported in people who smoke, have diabetes, or have coronary artery disease. No wonder people who sleep less than seven hours a night may experience a 12% to 35% increased risk of premature death compared to those who get a full seven hours. Yet a significant proportion of the population may routinely get less than that. Sufficiently long, restful sleep sessions each night are said to be an indisputable cornerstone of good health. Okay, so what can we do about it? Those who have sleep apnea, a common consequence of obesity that interferes with sleep, benefit from the use of CPAP machines while they\'re losing the weight to treat the underlying cause, hopefully. But what if apnea isn\'t your problem? What if you just have trouble falling asleep or staying asleep? In my book How Not to Diet, I have a whole section on sleep enhancement, where I go through the Four Rules of Sleep Conditioning and the Four Rules of Sleep Hygiene. What if you follow those guidelines but still can\'t get to sleep? Any natural dietary remedies? I already have videos on using kiwifruit to fight insomnia, and tart cherries, too. Are there any vegetables that might help? Lactuca sativa is a plant that has been traditionally used in the treatment of insomnia. What is this exotic sounding leafy vegetable? Lettuce! Evidently lettuce extracts have been used from the time of the Roman Empire as agents with sedative and sleep-inducing properties. Lettuce actually does have a hypnotic substance in it called lactucin, which is what makes lettuce taste a little bitter. But you don\'t know if it actually works until you put it to the test. And it works...in toads. But it also works in rodents. Sleep in both mice and rats is enhanced by romaine lettuce. They used romaine since it has a higher lactucin content compared to other lettuces. Okay, but does it work in people? About 10 years ago, a study was published in which insomnia sufferers were randomized to receive lettuce seed oil, oil extracted from lettuce seeds. Within a week, about 70% of those in the lettuce seed oil group said their insomnia very much or much improved, compared to only 20% in the placebo control group. The researchers concluded that lettuce seed oil was found to be a useful, safe sleeping aid in geriatric patients suffering from sleeping difficulties. They chose to study older individuals because insomnia affects surprisingly 20 to 40% of older adults at least a few nights a month. You think that\'s bad. Sleep disturbances can plague as many as nearly 8 out of 10 women during pregnancy. Of course, there\'s lots of different sleeping pills, but they may endanger the fetus or mother. For example, doctors frequently prescribe Ambien for pregnant women who have trouble sleeping, but Ambien use is associated with a wide range of adverse pregnancy outcomes like low birth weight babies, premature birth, and cesarean section. And the use of valium during pregnancy has been linked to birth defects including limb deficiencies. There has to be a better way. What about trying lettuce? The lettuce oil study had a number of limitations. For example, it was only single-blind, meaning the researchers knew who was on the lettuce supplements and who was on placebo, which could have introduced some bias. But the researchers essentially said, ""Give us a break. Big pharma has billions to spend on research. No one wants to fund studies on lettuce."" Finally, we got a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, but this time on a whole food, not just a lettuce seed extract. Yeah, but how do you come up with a placebo lettuce? How are you going to hide who gets lettuce and who doesn\'t? Well, you can\'t fit a head of lettuce into a capsule, but you can fit whole lettuce seeds. And here we go: a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trial on lettuce seeds for pregnancy-related insomnia. A hundred pregnant women with insomnia were randomized to receive capsules containing either a quarter teaspoon of ground lettuce seeds or a placebo for two weeks, and those on the lettuce seeds saw a significant improvement in a sleep quality index score compared to placebo with no reported side effects.

But researchers at MIT dispelled those myths about a decade ago. Tryptophan is one amino acid among many found in proteins, and they all compete with one another for transport across the blood-brain barrier, into the brain. And, since tryptophan is present in most animal proteins in relatively small quantities, it gets muscled out of the way. If you eat plant foods, though, the carbohydrates cause a release of insulin, which causes your muscles to take up the non-tryptophan amino acids as fuel. And so, your tryptophan can be first in line for brain access. Animal foods can even make things worse: “When tryptophan is ingested as part of a protein meal, serum tryptophan levels rise, but brain tryptophan levels decline… due to the mechanism of transport used by tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier.” The tryptophan levels in those given a high-protein turkey, egg, cheese breakfast dropped, whereas in the waffle-OJ group, their tryptophan levels went up. This may actually explain the carbohydrate cravings one sees in PMS— your brain may be trying to get you to boost tryptophan levels to feel better. “Consumption of a carbohydrate-rich, protein-poor evening test meal during the premenstrual period improved depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, fatigue, alertness, and calmness scores [significantly] among patients with premenstrual syndrome.” “Because synthesis of brain serotonin, which is known to be involved in mood and appetite, increases after carbohydrate intake, premenstrual syndrome subjects may overconsume carbohydrates in an attempt to improve their dysphoric mood state.” Ideally, though, it would be more than just carbs— we’ll cover the ideal mixture in tomorrow’s video-of-the-day.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Sleep and weight loss: Even getting just one more hour of sleep a night may help with weight control.\n\nThis video was based on the sleep section in my book, How Not to Diet, which you can learn more about here (https://nutritionfacts.org/book/how-not-to-diet/) (all proceeds go to charity), or check out my presentation based on the book: Evidence-Based Weight Loss (https://nutritionfacts.org/video/evidence-based-weight-loss-live-presentation/).\n\nIf you missed the previous video, see Does Lack of Sleep Cause You to Gain Weight?

This may help explain why studies show that those eating plant-based diets have superior mood states.

The findings of better mood scores in those eating vegetarian is consistent with both cross-sectional (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/plant-based-diet-mood/) and interventional (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/improving-mood-through-diet/) findings I've reported previously. The reason I report more data on nuts than seeds is due to researchers' greater access to funding for studies involving nuts (thanks to producer groups). From what little data we have, though, I have a feeling it's like the soy versus other beans story (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/soy-worth-a-hill-of-beans/). If I had to guess, I'd bet that, in general, seeds may be even healthier than nuts, and since I encourage daily nut consumption, I'd add seeds to that recommendation as well.

Since the main determinant of brain serotonin concentrations appears to be the ratio of tryptophan with others that compete with it for uptake into the brain, to maximize the mood- elevating effects of diet, one would ideally choose a snack with a high tryptophan-to-total protein ratio— which would mean primarily seeds, such as sesame, sunflower, pumpkin. “Protein-source tryptophan as an efficacious treatment for social anxiety disorder: a pilot study.” So, what protein source did they use? Butternut squash seeds, because of their high tryptophan-to-protein ratio, as part of a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of people suffering from social phobia, also known as social anxiety disorder. And, they found significant improvement in multiple objective measures of anxiety in those eating the squash seed bars. Before studies like this one, “a change in the composition of intact dietary protein was not seen as a possible option for the treatment of common psychological disorders associated with low serotonin levels.” But, that’s because they were Using animal proteins (which can make things worse), not plants. If this is true, then those eating vegetarian should be golden. And, indeed, this was the reasoning used to explain why “Global mood… was significantly better in the ‘vegetarian’ than in the ‘mixed’ diet group.” It’s all about carbohydrates, and a huge tryptophan-to-protein ratio. “The vegetarian group was instructed to avoid meat, fish, and poultry and to restrict intake of milk, milk products and eggs to a minimum…” And, within three weeks, the vegetarian diet groups had a significantly improved global mood.')]","Several plant-based foods have been identified as potentially helpful in improving sleep quality due to their melatonin content. Melatonin is a hormone that plays a crucial role in regulating sleep cycles. Here are some foods that might help improve deep sleep and reduce frequent awakenings during the night:

1. **Tart Cherries and Tart Cherry Juice**: Studies have shown that tart cherry juice can increase melatonin levels and improve sleep quality and duration. This effect is attributed to the natural melatonin present in cherries. It's important to choose tart cherries or their juice, as sweet cherries contain significantly less melatonin.

2. **Kiwifruit**: Consuming two kiwifruits one hour before bedtime may improve sleep onset, duration, and efficiency. This effect could be due to the antioxidant and serotonin content in kiwifruit, although the exact mechanism isn't fully understood.

3. **Goji Berries (also known as Lycium berries)**: Goji berries are another source of melatonin and might help in improving sleep. They are also known as a potent source of antioxidants.

4. **Nuts and Seeds**: Specifically, almonds and flaxseeds have been mentioned as sources of melatonin. Consuming these might help increase melatonin levels naturally.

5. **Lettuce and Lettuce Seed Oil**: Lettuce, particularly its seed oil, has been used traditionally and in some studies to aid sleep due to a substance called lactucin, which may have sedative properties.

6. **Pistachios**: These nuts are extremely rich in melatonin compared to other plant foods. Just a small amount of pistachios could significantly boost melatonin levels and potentially improve sleep quality.

These foods contain components that might help enhance the quality of sleep by influencing melatonin levels or through other bioactive compounds they possess. Including these in your diet, especially in the evening, might help in achieving better sleep quality and reducing night-time awakenings. However, it's also important to maintain good sleep hygiene and consult healthcare providers for persistent sleep issues.","Several plant-based foods have been identified as potentially helpful in improving sleep quality due to their melatonin content.

Three apples or three pears a day as snacks between meals on top of whatever else they were eating. Fruit is low in calories, but not zero, so if you add food to people’s diets, even healthy foods won’t they gain weight? No, they lost a couple pounds. Maybe it was all that fiber? If you remember, we learned our gut bacteria can create anti-obesity compounds from fiber, that’s why they had also had a cookie group. Three apples, three pears, or three cookies with enough oats in them to have about the same amount of fiber as the fruit. Despite the fiber, adding cookies to one’s diet does not lead to weight loss. They think the weight- reducing secret of fruit is it’s low energy density, meaning you get a lot of food for just a few calories, and so it fills you up. Energy density is a relatively new concept that has been identified as an important factor in body weight control in both adults and in children and adolescents. Energy density is defined as the amount of calories per unit weight of a food or beverage. Water, for example, provides a significant amount of weight without adding calories. Fiber too. Thus, foods high in  fiber and water are generally lower in energy density. On the other hand, because dietary fat provides the greatest amount of calories per unit weight, foods high in fat are generally high in energy density. The CDC offers some examples. High energy density foods are like bacon— lots of calories in a small package. A medium energy density food is like a bagel, and low density foods are typified by fruits and vegetables. In general, the lower the better, with two exceptions. Soda is so heavy that by energy density it looks less harmful than it is. And nuts have so much fat they appear less healthy than they are. Otherwise, though, the science supports a relationship between energy density and body weight, such that consuming diets lower in energy density may be an effective strategy for weight control. This is because people tend to eat a consistent weight of food, so when there’s less calories per pound, calorie intake is reduced. A small drop in energy density can lead to a small drop in weight, and the greater the decrease in energy density the greater the weight loss. Energy density can be reduced in a variety of ways such as the addition of vegetables or fruits to recipes or by lowering the fat or sugar content. And indeed that’s how we evolved, eating predominantly low energy density foods such as fruits, vegetables, plants and tubers, starch-filled roots like sweet potatoes. The first study to emphasize how fruits and vegetables could affect energy density and food intake was conducted more than 30 years ago. Researchers were able to cut people’s caloric intake nearly in half, from 3000 calories a day down to 1570 without cutting portions, just by substituting less calorie dense foods, which means lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans, compared to a high energy density meal with lots of meat and sugar. Nearly half the calories, but they enjoyed the meals just as much. They tried this in Hawaii, putting folks on a traditional Hawaiian diet with all the plant foods they could eat. They lost an average of 17 pounds in just 21 days, resulting in better cholesterol, triglycerides, blood sugars, and blood pressure. Caloric intake dropped 40%, but not by eating less food. In fact they lost 17 pounds in 21 days eating more food- four pounds of food. But because plants tend to be so calorically dilute, one can stuff oneself without getting the same kind of weight gain. And the energy density of foods is of interest for weight management not only because it allows people to eat satisfying portions while limiting calories, but also because reductions in energy density are associated with improved dietary quality. For example, lower energy dense diets are associated with lower risk of pancreatic cancer. Lower energy dense diets tend to be of healthier foods, so we get the best of both worlds.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Energy density explains how a study can show participants lose an average of 17 pounds within 21 days while eating a greater quantity of food.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

So when we start losing weight, we may unconsciously start moving less as a behavioral adaptation to conserve energy. There are metabolic adaptations as well. Our metabolism slows down. Every pound of weight loss may reduce our resting metabolic rate by seven calories a day. This may only translate to a few percent differences for most, but can rapidly snowball for those who achieve massive weight loss. During one session, some of The Biggest Loser contestants famously had their metabolic rates tracked. Above and beyond the hundreds of calories less it takes to just exist 100+ pounds lighter, by the end of the season their metabolic rates slowed by an extra 500 calories a day. The mindblower was that six years later they were retested and still had the 500-calorie-a-day handicap. So the contestants had to cut 500 calories more than anyone else their size to maintain the same weight loss. No wonder the bulk of their weight was regained. Most remained at least 10% lower than their starting weight, though, and even a 7% drop has been shown to cut diabetes rates about in half. Still, the metabolic slowing means you have to work that much harder than everyone else just to stay in place. Analyzing four seasons of The Biggest Loser, minute-by-minute, researchers noted that 85% of the focus was on exercise rather than diet, though the exercise component accounted for less than half of the weight loss. Even six years after their season ended, the contestants had been maintaining an hour of daily, vigorous exercise, yet still regained most of the weight. Why? Because they  started eating more. They could have  cut their exercise to just 20 minutes a day and still maintained 100% of their initial weight loss if they would have just been able to keep their intake to under 3,000 calories a day. That may not sound like much of a challenge, but weight loss doesn\'t just slow your metabolism; it boosts your appetite. If it were just a matter of your weight settling at the point at which your reduced calorie intake matches your reduced calorie output, it would take years for your weight loss to plateau. Instead, it often happens within six to eight months. You may know the drill: Start the diet, stick to the diet, and then weight loss stalls six months later. What happened? Don\'t blame your metabolism; that just plays a small part. What happened is that you likely actually stopped sticking to your diet because your appetite went on a rampage. Let\'s break it down. If you cut 800 calories out of your daily diet— 2600 calories a day down to 1800— and your weight loss stalls after six months, then what happened is that at the end of the first month you think you\'re still cutting 800 calories, but you may actually only be down about 600 calories a day. By month two you\'re only down about 500, month three, 300, and by month six you\'re only eating 200 calories less than before you went on the diet. In other words, you inadvertently suffered an exponential increase in calorie intake over those six months. Yet you may not even realize it, because by that time your body may have ramped your appetite up 600 calories. So, it still feels as if you are eating 800 calories less, but it\'s actually only 200. Since an 800 calorie drop in intake may slow your metabolism and physical activity about 200 calories a day, with no difference between Calories In and Calories Out at six months, no wonder your weight loss grinds to a complete halt. The slow upward drift in calorie intake on a new diet is not because you got lazy. Once your appetite is boosted by 600 calories after dieting for a while, eating 200 calories less at the end is as hard as eating 800 calories less at the beginning. So you can maintain the same disciplined level of willpower and self-control and still end up stagnating. To prevent this from happening, you need to maintain the calorie deficit. How is that possible in the face of a ravenous appetite? Hunger is a biological drive. Asking someone to eat smaller portions is like asking someone to take fewer breaths. You can white-knuckle it for a bit, but eventually nature wins out. That\'s why I wrote How Not to Diet. There are foods that can counter the slowing of our metabolism and suppress our appetite, ways of eating to counter the behavioral adaptation and even eat more food yet still lose weight. Due to the metabolic slowing and increased appetite that accompanies weight loss, sustained weight loss requires a persistent calorie deficit of 300 to 500 calories a day. This can be accomplished without reducing portion sizes simply by lowering the calorie density of meals. This can result in the rare combination of weight loss with both an increase in quality and even quantity of food consumed. I\'m going to do a whole series of videos about it. The bottom line is that sustainable weight loss is not about eating less food; it\'s about eating better food.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'How can we use sensory-specific satiety to our advantage?\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

That\'s why your 10th bite of chocolate, for example, doesn\'t taste as good as the first bite. We have a built-in biological drive to get us to keep changing up our foods, so we\'ll be more likely to hit all of our nutritional requirements. The drive is so powerful that even imagined consumption reduces actual consumption. If you have someone imagine they\'re eating cheese, for example, over and over, and then you give them actual cheese, they eat less of it than those who hadn\'t been imagining they were eating cheese. Ironically, habituation may be one of the reasons fad ""mono diets"" like the cabbage soup diet and the oatmeal diet, or meal replacement shakes can actually result in better adherence and lower ratings of hunger compared to less restrictive diets. In the landmark study ""A Satiety Index of Common Foods,"" in which dozens of foods were put to the test, boiled potatoes were found to be the most satiating food. 240 calories of boiled potatoes were found to be more satisfying in terms of quelling hunger than the same number of calories of any other food tested. No other food even came close. No doubt potatoes\' low-calorie density played a role. For people to eat 240 calories of spuds, the researchers had to feed them nearly a pound of potatoes, compared to just a few cookies, for example, but that\'s kind of the point. They had to feed people even more apples, grapes, and oranges, though, yet each fruit was still about 40% less satiating than the potatoes. So, an all-potato diet would probably take the gold—the Yukon gold—for the most bland, monotonous, and satiating diet. Mono diets, where you just eat one thing, are the poster child for unsustainability however, and thank heavens for that. Over time they can lead to serious nutrient deficiencies, like blindness from vitamin A deficiency in the case of white potatoes. The satiating power of potatoes can still be brought to bear, though. Boiled potatoes beat out rice and pasta in terms of a satiating side dish, cutting as much as about 200 calories of intake off a meal. Compared to boiled and mashed potatoes, French fries or even baked ones do not appear to have the same satiating impact. To exploit habituation for weight loss while maintaining nutrient abundance, you could limit the variety of unhealthy foods you eat, while expanding the variety of healthy foods. In that way you can simultaneously take advantage of the appetite suppressing effects of monotony while diversifying your fruit and vegetable portfolio. Studies have shown that a greater variety of calorie dense foods like sweets and snacks are associated with excess body fat, but a greater vegetable variety appeared protective. Presented with a greater variety of fruit, a greater variety of vegetables, and greater variety of vegetable seasonings, people may consume a greater quantity, crowding out less healthy options. For the first 20 years of the official Dietary Guidelines for Americans, they recommended generally eating a variety of foods. In the new millennium they\'ve started getting more precise, specifying a diversity of healthier foods only. As a pair of Harvard and NYU dietitians concluded in a paper on dietary variety as an overlooked strategy for obesity and chronic disease control, ""Choose and prepare a greater variety of plant-based foods,"" recognizing that a greater variety of less healthy options could be counterproductive. So, how can we respond to industry attempts to lure us into temptation by turning our natural biological drives against us? Should we never eat really delicious food? No, but it may help to recognize the effects hyperpalatable foods can have on hijacking our appetites and undermining our bodies better judgment. We can also use some of those same primitive impulses to our advantage by monotonizing our choices of the bad and diversifying our choices of the good. In ""How Not to Diet"" I call it ""Meatball Monotony and Veggie Variety."" Try picking out a new fruit or vegetable every time you shop. In my own family\'s home, we always have a wide array of healthy snacks on hand to entice the finickiest of tastes. The contrasting collage of colors and shapes in fruit baskets and vegetable platters beat out boring bowls of a single fruit because they make you want to mix it up and try a little of each.

The new data is said to debunk “some, if not all, of the popular claims made by extreme carbohydrate restriction.” But what about ketones suppressing your hunger? In the tightly controlled metabolic ward study where the ketogenic diet made things worse, everyone was made to eat the same number of calories. So yes, eat the same number of calories on a keto diet and lose less body fat, but out in the real-world maybe all those ketones would spoil your appetite enough that you’d end up eating significantly less over all. On a low-carb diet people ended up storing 300 more calories of fat every day. But outside the laboratory, if you were in a state of ketosis, maybe you could offset that if you were able to sustainably eat significantly less. Paradoxically, people may experience less hunger on a total fast compared to an extremely low-calorie diet. This may be thanks to ketones; in this state of ketosis, when you have high levels of ketones in your bloodstream, your hunger is dampened. How do we know it’s the ketones? Because if you inject ketones straight into people’s veins, even those who are not fasting lose their appetite, sometimes even to the point of getting nauseated and vomiting. So, ketones can explain why after a few days you might feel hungrier on a low-calorie diet than on a total zero- calorie diet (a fast). Can we then exploit the appetite-suppressing effects of ketosis by eating a ketogenic diet? If you ate so few carbs to sustain brain function, couldn’t you trick your body into thinking you’re fasting and get your liver to start pumping out ketones? Sure! But is it safe, and is it effective? A meta-analysis of 48 randomized trials of various branded diets found that those advised to eat low-carb diets and those told to eat low-fat diets lost nearly identical amounts of weight after a year. Now obviously, high attrition rates and poor dietary adherence complicate comparisons of efficacy— I mean they weren’t actually put on these diets; they were just told to eat that way. But you could see how even just moving in each respective direction can get rid of a lot of CRAP, which is Jeff Novick’s beloved acronym for Calorie-Rich and Processed foods. After all, the four largest calorie contributors in the American diet are refined grains, added fats, meat, and added sugars. Low-carb diets cut down on 1 and 4, and low-fat diets tend to cut down on 2 and 3. So they both tell people to cut down on doughnuts. Any diet that does that already has a leg up. I figure a don’t-eat-anything-that -starts-with-the-letter-D diet could also successfully cause weight loss if it caused people to cut down on doughnuts, danishes, and Doritos, even if makes no nutritional sense to exclude something like dill. The secret to long-term weight loss success on any diet is compliance. Diet adherence is difficult, though, because any time you try to cut calories your body ramps up your appetite to try to compensate. This is why traditional weight loss approaches like portion control tend to fail. For long-term success, measured not in weeks or months but in years and decades, this day-to-day hunger problem must be overcome. On a wholesome plant-based diet this can be accomplished thanks in part to calorie density— you’re just eating so much food. On a ketogenic diet it may be accomplished with ketosis. In a systematic review and meta-analysis entitled ""Do ketogenic diets really suppress appetite?” The answer, they found, was yes. Also, ketogenic diets offer the unique advantage of being able to track dietary compliance in real-time with ketone test strips you can pee on to see if you’re still in ketosis. There’s no pee stick that will tell you if you’re eating enough fruits and veggies. All you have is the bathroom scale. Keto compliance may be more in theory than practice, though. Even in studies where ketogenic diets are being used to control seizures, after a few months dietary compliance may drop to under 50 percent. This can be tragic for those with intractable epilepsy, but for everyone else, the difficulty in sticking to ketogenic diets long-term may actually be a life-saver.

If you’re interested in more on weight loss, look no further than my book How Not to Diet, and of course lots of videos if you go to NutritionFacts.org and just type in ""weight loss"" in the search bar and you can watch to your heart’s content. ""Are Weight Loss Supplements Safe and Effective?"" According to a national survey, a third of adults who’ve made serious attempts at weight loss have tried using dietary supplements, for which Americans spend literally billions of dollars every year. Most mistakenly thought that over-the-counter appetite suppressants, herbal products, and weight loss supplements had to be approved for safety by some governmental agency, like the FDA, before being sold to the public, or at least include some kind of warning on the label about potential side effects. Nearly half even thought they had to demonstrate some sort of effectiveness. None of that is true. The Food and Drug Administration estimates that dietary supplements in general cause 50,000 adverse events annually, most commonly liver and kidney damage. Of course, prescription drugs don’t just adversely effect, but kill more than 100,000 Americans every year, but at least you notionally have the opportunity to parse out the risks versus benefits thanks to testing and monitoring requirements, typically involving thousands of individuals. When the manufacturer of the ephedrine- containing supplement Metabolife 356 had it tested—on just 35 people— only minor side effects were found, such as dry mouth, insomnia, and headaches, however, once unleashed on the populace, nearly 15,000 adverse effects were reported before it was pulled from the market, including heart attacks, strokes, seizures, and deaths. Given the lack of government oversight, there’s no guarantee that what’s on the label is even in the bottle. FDA inspectors have found 70% of supplement manufacturers violated so-called Good Manufacturing Practices, which are considered the minimum quality standards. This includes things like basic sanitation and ingredient identification. Not 7% in violation, 70%. DNA testing of herbal supplements across North America found that most could not be authenticated. In 68 percent of the supplements tested, the main labeled ingredient was missing completely and substituted for something else. For example,“St. John’s wort” supplement containing nothing but senna, a laxative that can cause anal blistering. Only 2 out of 12 supplement companies had products that were accurately labeled. This problem isn’t limited to just fly-by-night phonies in some dark corner of the internet. The New York State Attorney General commissioned DNA testing of 78 bottles of commercial herbal supplements sold by Walgreens, Walmart, Target, and GNC. Four out of five bottles didn\'t contain any of the herbs on their labels. Instead, capsules were often little more than cheap fillers like powdered rice “and houseplants.” In my last video I noted that one investigation found four of out five bottles of commercial herbal supplements bought at major retailers didn’t contain any of the herbs on their labels, instead often containing little more than cheap fillers like powdered \'rice and ""houseplants"".\' At least you hope it just contains houseplants. Weight loss supplements are infamous for being adulterated with drugs. In a sampling of 160 weight loss supplements that claimed to be “100 percent natural,” more than half were tainted with drugs, active pharmacological ingredients, ranging from antidepressants like Prozac to erectile dysfunction meds like Viagra. Diuretic drugs are frequent contaminants, which makes sense. In my Keto videos, I talk about rapid water loss as the billion-dollar gimmick that has sold low-carb diets for more than a century. But why the Viagra? At least the spiked Viagra and Prozac are drugs that are legal. Researchers in Denver tested every weight loss supplement they could find within a 10-mile radius and alarmingly found a third were adulterated with banned ingredients. The most common illegal adulterant of weight loss supplements is sibutramine, which was sold as Meridia before it was yanked off the market back in 2010 for heart attack and stroke risk; now also blamed for cases of slimming supplement-induced psychosis. An analysis of weight loss supplements bought off the internet advertised with claims such as “purely natural"", ""harmless"", or ""traditional herbal"", found that a third contained high-dose banned sibutramine, and the rest contained caffeine. Wouldn’t you be able to tell if caffeine was added to a supplement? Perhaps not if it also had Temazepam added, a controlled substance (benzodiazepine) “downer” sedative found in half of the caffeine-tainted supplements. Doesn’t the FDA demand recalls of adulterated supplements? Yeah, but they just pop right back up on store shelves. Twenty-seven supplements purchased at least six months after the recalls were released, and two-thirds still contained banned substances—17 out of the 27— with the same pharmaceutical adulterant found originally, and six containing one or more additional banned ingredients. Aren’t the manufacturers penalized for noncompliance? Yes, but “fines for violations are small compared to the profits.” One of the ways supplement makers can skirt the law is by labeling them as “not intended for human consumption,” for example labelling the fatal fat-burner DNP as an industrial or research chemical. That’s like how designer street drugs can be sold openly at gas stations and convenience stores as “bath salts.” Another way is to claim synthetic stimulants added to slimming supplements are actually natural food constituents, like listing the designer drug dimethylamylamine (DMAA) as “geranium oil extract.” The FDA banned it in 2012 after it was determined that DMAA was “not found in geraniums.” (And who eats geraniums anyway?) Despite being tentatively tied to cases of sudden death and hemorrhagic stroke, DMAA has continued to be found in weight loss supplements with innocuous names like Simply Skinny Pollen made by Bee Fit with Trish. There is little doubt that certain banned supplements, like ephedra, could help people lose weight. “There’s only one problem,” wrote a founding member of the American Board of Integrative Medicine: “This supplement may kill you.” Are there any safe and effective dietary supplements for weight loss? When popular slimming supplements were put to the test in a randomized placebo- controlled trial, not a single one could beat out sugar pills. A systematic review of systematic reviews of diet pills came to a similar conclusion: none appear to generate appreciable impacts “on body weight without undue risks.” That was the conclusion reached in a similar review out of the Weight Management Center at Johns Hopkins recently, which ended with this: “It is fitting to highlight that perhaps the most general and safest alternative/ herbal approach to weight control is to substitute low-[calorie] density foods for high-[calorie] density and processed foods, thereby reducing total [calorie] intake.” In other words, more whole plant foods and fewer animal foods and junk. “By taking advantage of the low-[calorie] density and health-promoting effects of plant-based foods, one may be able to achieve weight loss, or at least assist weight maintenance without cutting down on the volume of food consumed or compromising its nutrient value.”'), Document(metadata={'description': 'In his newest live presentation from 2019, Dr. Greger offers a sneak peek into his new book How Not to Diet, which hones in on the optimal criteria to enable weight loss while considering how these foods actually affect our health and longevity.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

That’s like the way our gut flora communicates with us, dialing down our appetite, all the while increasing the rate at which we burn fat and boosting our metabolism at the same time. All thanks to fiber. Check this out. Put people on a brain scanner and show them a high-calorie food like a donut and the reward centers in their brains instantly light up. But, if you repeat the experiment, but this time, secretly deliver fiber-derived short-chain fatty acids directly into their colon, you get a blunted reward center response and subjects report that high-calorie foods just seemed less appetizing, and subsequently ate less of an all-you-can-eat meal. But fiber supplements like Metamucil don’t work, which makes sense because they're non fermentable, meaning our gut bacteria can’t eat them; so, yeah, they can improve bowel regularity, but can’t be used by our good bacteria to make those compounds that can block our cravings. For that, we have to actually eat real food. Our good gut bugs are trying to help us, but when we eat a diet deficient in fiber, we are in effect starving our microbial self. Less than 5% of Americans reach even the recommended minimum daily adequate intake of fiber, no surprise since the number one sources are beans and whole grains, and 96% of Americans don’t even reach the recommended minimum intake of legumes (which are beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils), and 99% don’t reach the recommended minimum for whole grains. Most people don’t even know what fiber is. More than half of Americans surveyed think that steak is a significant source of fiber. However, by definition, fiber is only found in plants. There is zero fiber in meat, eggs, or dairy, and typically little or no fiber in processed junk, and therein lies the problem. But wouldn’t at least the protein in that steak fill you up? Surprisingly, even a review supported by the meat, dairy, and egg industries acknowledged that protein intake does not actually translate into eating less later on, whereas you eat a fiber-rich whole grain for supper, and it can cut your calorie intake more than 12 hours later at lunch the next day! You feel full a hundred calories quicker the following day because by then, your good gut bugs are feasting on the same bounty and dialing down your appetite. Today, even our meat could be considered junk food. For more than a century, one of the great goals of animal agriculture has been to increase the carcass fat content of farm animals. Take chicken, for example. A hundred years ago, the USDA determined chicken was about 23% protein by weight and less than 2% fat. Today, chickens have been genetically manipulated through selective breeding to have about ten times more fat. Chicken Little has become Chicken Big and may be making us bigger too. Meat consumption in general is associated with weight gain, but poultry appeared to be the worst. Even just an ounce a day—which is like a single chicken nugget, or like one chicken breast every ten days, was associated with weight gain compared to eating no chicken at all. You know, it’s funny, when the meat industry funds obesity studies on chicken, they choose for their head-to-head comparison, foods like “cookies and sugar-coated chocolates.” This is a classic drug industry trick to try to make your product look better by comparing it to something worse. Apparently, just regular chocolate wasn’t enough to make chicken look better. But what happens when chicken is pitted against a real control, like chicken without the actual chicken? Chicken chickens out. Both soy-based proteins and Quorn, which is a plant-based meat made from the mushroom kingdom, were found to have stronger satiating qualities than chicken. Feed people a chicken and rice lunch, and four-and-a-half hours later, they eat 18% more of a dinner buffet than had they instead been given a chicken- free chicken and rice lunch. These findings are consistent with childhood obesity research that found that meat consumption seemed to double the odds of school children becoming overweight, compared to the consumption of plant-based meat products. Whole-food sources of plant protein such as beans did even better though, associated with cutting in half the odds of becoming overweight. So, that’s why I consider these kinds of plant-based meats more of a useful stepping stone towards a healthier diet, rather than the end-game goal/ideal. Part of the reason plant-based meats may be less fattening is they cause less of an insulin spike. A meat-free chicken like Quorn causes up to 41% less of an immediate insulin reaction. It turns out animal protein causes almost exactly as much insulin release as pure sugar. Just adding some egg whites to your diet can increase insulin output as much as a 60% within four days. And fish may be even worse. Why would adding tuna to mashed potatoes spike up insulin levels, but adding broccoli instead cut the insulin response by about 40%? It’s not the fiber, since giving the same amount of broccoli fiber alone provided no significant benefit. So, why does animal protein make things worse but plant protein makes things better? Plant proteins tend to be lower in the branched-chain amino acids which are associated with insulin resistance, the cause of type 2 diabetes. You can show this experimentally. Give some vegans branched-chain amino acids, and you can make them as insulin resistant as omnivores. Or, take some omnivores and put them even through a “48-hour vegan diet challenge,” and, within two days, you can see the opposite— there's a significant improvement in metabolic health. Why? Because decreased consumption of branched-chain amino acids improves metabolic health. Check this out. Those randomized to restrict their protein intake were averaging literally hundreds more calories a day; so, they should have become fatter right? But no, they actually lost more body fat. Restricting their protein enabled them to eat more calories, while at the same time they lost more weight. More calories, yet a loss in body fat. And this magic “protein restriction”? They were just having people eat the recommended amounts of protein. So, maybe they should have just called this group the normal protein group, or the recommended protein group, and the group that was eating more typical American protein levels and suffering because of it, the excess protein group. Given the metabolic harms of excess branched-chain amino acid exposure, leaders in the field have suggested the invention of drugs to block their absorption, to “promote metabolic health and treat diabetes and obesity without reducing caloric intake.” Or, we can just try not to eat so many branched-chain amino acids in the first place. They are found mostly in meat, including chicken and fish, dairy products, and eggs, perhaps explaining why animal protein is associated with higher diabetes risk, whereas plant protein appears protective. So, defining the appropriate upper limits of animal protein intake may offer a great chance for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and obesity, but it need not be all or nothing. Even an intermittent vegan diet has been shown to be beneficial. If there was one piece of advice that sums up the recommendations in my upcoming book it would be: “Wall Off Your Calories.” Animal cells are encased only in easily digestible membranes, which allows the enzymes in our gut to effortlessly liberate the calories in a steak, for example. Plant cells, on the other hand, have cell walls that are made out of fiber, which present an indigestible physical barrier; so, many of the calories remain trapped. Now, processed plant foods, however, fruit juice, sugar, refined grains, even whole grains if they have been powdered into flour, have had their cellular structure destroyed, their cell walls cracked open and their calories are free for the taking. But when you eat structurally intact plant foods, chew all you want— you’re still going to end up with calories completely surrounded by fiber, which then blunts the glycemic impact, activates the ileal brake, and delivers sustenance to your friendly flora. So, bottom line, try to make sure as many of your calories as possible— your protein, your carbs, your fat— are encased in cell walls, in other words from whole, intact plant foods. That’s what nature intended to happen. Millions of years before we learned how to sharpen spears and mill grains and boil sugar cane, our entire physiology is presumed to have evolved in the context of eating what the rest of our great ape cousins eat: plants. The Paleolithic period, when we started using tools, only goes back about two million years. We and the great apes have been evolving since back in the Miocene era, more like twenty million years ago. So, for the first 90% of our hominoid existence, our bodies evolved on mostly plants. It’s no wonder then that our bodies may thrive best on the diet we were designed to eat. So, maybe we should go back to our roots. [clears throat] With enough portion control, anyone can lose weight. Lock someone in a closet, and you can force them to lose as much body fat as you want. Chaining someone to a treadmill could probably have a similar effect. But what is the most effective weight-loss regimen that doesn’t involve calorie restriction or exercise—or a felony? I scoured through the medical literature and all the randomized controlled trials, and the single most successful strategy to date is a diet of whole plant foods. The single most effective weight loss intervention like that ever published in the peer-reviewed medical literature, a whole food, plant-based diet. That works better than anything else studied to date. And, no wonder given what we just learned about fiber and branched-chain amino acids. We’ve known for more than forty years that those eating predominantly plant-based diets weigh, on average, about thirty pounds less than the general population, but you don’t know if it’s the""), Document(metadata={'description': 'In this live presentation, Dr. Greger offers a sneak peek into his book How Not to Diet.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Today, even our meat could be considered junk food. For more than a century, one of the great goals of animal agriculture has been to increase the carcass fat content of farm animals. Take chicken, for example. A hundred years ago, the USDA determined chicken was about 23% protein by weight and less than 2% fat. Today, chickens have been genetically manipulated through selective breeding to have about ten times more fat. Chicken Little has become Chicken Big and may be making us bigger too. Meat consumption in general is associated with weight gain, but poultry appeared to be the worst. Even just an ounce a day—which is like a single chicken nugget, or like one chicken breast every ten days, was associated with weight gain compared to eating no chicken at all. You know, it’s funny, when the meat industry funds obesity studies on chicken, they choose for their head-to-head comparison, foods like “cookies and sugar-coated chocolates.” This is a classic drug industry trick to try to make your product look better by comparing it to something worse. Apparently, just regular chocolate wasn’t enough to make chicken look better. But what happens when chicken is pitted against a real control, like chicken without the actual chicken? Chicken chickens out. Both soy-based proteins and Quorn, which is a plant-based meat made from the mushroom kingdom, were found to have stronger satiating qualities than chicken. Feed people a chicken and rice lunch, and four-and-a-half hours later, they eat 18% more of a dinner buffet than had they instead been given a chicken- free chicken and rice lunch. These findings are consistent with childhood obesity research that found that meat consumption seemed to double the odds of school children becoming overweight, compared to the consumption of plant-based meat products. Whole-food sources of plant protein such as beans did even better though, associated with cutting in half the odds of becoming overweight. So, that’s why I consider these kinds of plant-based meats more of a useful stepping stone towards a healthier diet, rather than the end-game goal/ideal. Part of the reason plant-based meats may be less fattening is they cause less of an insulin spike. A meat-free chicken like Quorn causes up to 41% less of an immediate insulin reaction. It turns out animal protein causes almost exactly as much insulin release as pure sugar. Just adding some egg whites to your diet can increase insulin output as much as a 60% within four days. And fish may be even worse. Why would adding tuna to mashed potatoes spike up insulin levels, but adding broccoli instead cut the insulin response by about 40%? It’s not the fiber, since giving the same amount of broccoli fiber alone provided no significant benefit. So, why does animal protein make things worse but plant protein makes things better? Plant proteins tend to be lower in the branched-chain amino acids which are associated with insulin resistance, the cause of type 2 diabetes. You can show this experimentally. Give some vegans branched-chain amino acids, and you can make them as insulin resistant as omnivores. Or, take some omnivores and put them even through a “48-hour vegan diet challenge,” and, within two days, you can see the opposite— there's a significant improvement in metabolic health. Why? Because decreased consumption of branched-chain amino acids improves metabolic health. Check this out. Those randomized to restrict their protein intake were averaging literally hundreds more calories a day; so, they should have become fatter right? But no, they actually lost more body fat. Restricting their protein enabled them to eat more calories, while at the same time they lost more weight. More calories, yet a loss in body fat. And this magic “protein restriction”? They were just having people eat the recommended amounts of protein. So, maybe they should have just called this group the normal protein group, or the recommended protein group, and the group that was eating more typical American protein levels and suffering because of it, the excess protein group. Given the metabolic harms of excess branched-chain amino acid exposure, leaders in the field have suggested the invention of drugs to block their absorption, to “promote metabolic health and treat diabetes and obesity without reducing caloric intake.” Or, we can just try not to eat so many branched-chain amino acids in the first place. They are found mostly in meat, including chicken and fish, dairy products, and eggs, perhaps explaining why animal protein is associated with higher diabetes risk, whereas plant protein appears protective. So, defining the appropriate upper limits of animal protein intake may offer a great chance for the prevention of type 2 diabetes and obesity, but it need not be all or nothing. Even an intermittent vegan diet has been shown to be beneficial. If there was one piece of advice that sums up the recommendations in my upcoming book it would be: “Wall Off Your Calories.” Animal cells are encased only in easily digestible membranes, which allows the enzymes in our gut to effortlessly liberate the calories in a steak, for example. Plant cells, on the other hand, have cell walls that are made out of fiber, which present an indigestible physical barrier; so, many of the calories remain trapped. Now, processed plant foods, however, fruit juice, sugar, refined grains, even whole grains if they have been powdered into flour, have had their cellular structure destroyed, their cell walls cracked open and their calories are free for the taking. But when you eat structurally intact plant foods, chew all you want— you’re still going to end up with calories completely surrounded by fiber, which then blunts the glycemic impact, activates the ileal brake, and delivers sustenance to your friendly flora. So, bottom line, try to make sure as many of your calories as possible— your protein, your carbs, your fat— are encased in cell walls, in other words from whole, intact plant foods. That’s what nature intended to happen. Millions of years before we learned how to sharpen spears and mill grains and boil sugar cane, our entire physiology is presumed to have evolved in the context of eating what the rest of our great ape cousins eat: plants. The Paleolithic period, when we started using tools, only goes back about two million years. We and the great apes have been evolving since back in the Miocene era, more like twenty million years ago. So, for the first 90% of our hominoid existence, our bodies evolved on mostly plants. It’s no wonder then that our bodies may thrive best on the diet we were designed to eat. So, maybe we should go back to our roots. [clears throat] With enough portion control, anyone can lose weight. Lock someone in a closet, and you can force them to lose as much body fat as you want. Chaining someone to a treadmill could probably have a similar effect. But what is the most effective weight-loss regimen that doesn’t involve calorie restriction or exercise—or a felony? I scoured through the medical literature and all the randomized controlled trials, and the single most successful strategy to date is a diet of whole plant foods. The single most effective weight loss intervention like that ever published in the peer-reviewed medical literature, a whole food, plant-based diet. That works better than anything else studied to date. And, no wonder given what we just learned about fiber and branched-chain amino acids. We’ve known for more than forty years that those eating predominantly plant-based diets weigh, on average, about thirty pounds less than the general population, but you don’t know if it’s the""), Document(metadata={'description': 'Burn off significantly more body fat exercising before meals, rather than after them.\n\nWhy not just fast longer for weight loss?

Is it better to exercise in the morning or the evening? Before breakfast or after breakfast? There was a Nobel Prize- winning exercise physiologist who said he always ran a mile every morning before breakfast. Was he right? Let’s find out. More than a dozen experiments have been published comparing the amount of fat burned in a fasted versus fed state, and every single one found more fat was burned on an empty stomach. On average, a single bout of low- to-moderate intensity activity before a meal burned off three grams more fat than the same amount of exercise after a meal. That’s about three-quarters of a pat of butter’s worth of fat, enough to improve insulin sensitivity. The same amount of exercise, but more fat loss, all because of timing. Now, just because you burn more fat while you’re exercising doesn’t necessarily mean you end up  with less fat at the end of the day. Maybe your body offsets the extra fat loss that occurs during exercise with a little extra fat storage when you finally do eat, balancing it out. Researchers in Japan set out to investigate the possibility that your body makes up for it later by measuring 24-hour fat balance after 100 minutes of running either before breakfast or after lunch. On the exercise-after-lunch day, they burned a total of 608 calories of fat over the course of that day. In contrast, on the exercise- before-breakfast days, in the same 24-hour period they burned through nearly 90 percent more, 1,142 calories of straight fat. So, the next day, they woke up with about a quarter cup of fat less after the same amount of exercise. That’s remarkable! What about just something like walking? Sixty minutes before breakfast, after lunch, or after dinner. Over the 24 hours  they exercised in the evening, 432 calories were burned off. On the afternoon exercise day, they burned off 446 calories of fat. They also had a control day with no exercise at all, and on that day, they burned through 456 fat calories. That’s disappointing—it’s like they never walked at all. But the same amount of exercise before breakfast resulted in 717 calories of fat loss. Over the course of a day timing matters, so much so that when it comes to an hour of walking, exercise increases 24-hour fat burning only when it is performed before breakfast. Here’s the fat balance graph with no exercise. You can see the fat storage bump up at breakfast, lunch, and supper, before slowly coming back down overnight. Exercise in the afternoon or evening and end up with more fat than not exercising at all, but exercise in the morning and at least your fat balance comes back to baseline. All such similar studies on both men and women show we burn through more fat on the days we exercise before, rather than after eating. After reading the chronobiology chapter though or watching my chronobiology videos, an alternative explanation may spring to mind. Maybe it’s just a morning thing. Maybe it has nothing to do with meals, and your circadian rhythm is just dictating the difference. No. Exercising in the morning after breakfast appears no better than exercising in the evening after dinner, and exercising before breakfast works better than immediately after breakfast, both still in the morning. It really does seem to be a pre- versus post-meal effect. But why? Carbohydrate is the preferred fuel of the body. When you eat sugars or starches, they get broken down and converted into blood sugar. After a meal, blood sugars rise and your muscles are quick to snatch it up for fuel without having to rely much on your energy stores. If you instead take a siesta, and your muscles have no immediate need for energy, the excess blood sugar from a meal can be stored in our muscles in the form of glycogen for later use. Glycogen is just a bunch of blood sugar molecules strung together into a mass of branches that can be broken off and used for quick bursts of energy any time we need them. If you exercise after a meal, your muscles can siphon off some of the extra blood sugar floating around for energy. Before a meal, your muscles have to instead resort to dipping into your energy stores and end up burning mostly a combination of glycogen and fat. That explains why you burn more fat during fasted exercise, but what about all the extra fat burned throughout the rest of the day? Glycogen is more than a store. Glycogen isn’t just an energy reserve, but acts as a sensor capable of activating metabolic pathways. Exercising before breakfast can exhaust as much as 18 percent of your glycogen stores, and that depletion can act as a powerful rallying cry to your fatty tissues to start pulling more of their own weight by breaking down more fat. The lower glycogen stores fall, the greater the sustained 24-hour fat loss. How long do you have to go without food in order to trigger this effect? Six hours may be sufficient; so, it doesn’t have to be before breakfast. If you timed it right, you could exercise before a late lunch, or if you have an early enough lunch, maybe before dinner when you get home from work. If exercise in a fasted state isn’t possible, does it matter what you eat? Insulin release after a meal appears to play a critical role in suppressing fat breakdown, explaining why lower glycemic foods— in this case, muesli versus cornflakes— can have less of an effect. Lentils were identified as a promising option for maintaining athletic endurance (which can take a hit on an empty stomach) while maintaining more of the fat dissolution. Lentils are said to be unlikely to be consumed by the general population due to \'low palatability"". They obviously haven’t tried my mom’s lentil soup. It\'s worth mentioning that although there’s increased 24-hour fat burning exercising in a fasted state, the only way to see if this facilitates weight loss over time is to put it to the test, which we’ll explore next.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'In this live presentation, Dr. Greger offers a sneak peek into his book How Not to Diet.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

In 2017, a group of New Zealand researchers published the BROAD study, a twelve-week randomized controlled trial in the poorest region of the country with the highest obesity rates. Overweight individuals were randomized to receive either standard medical care or semi-weekly classes offering advice and encouragement to eat a low-fat diet centered around fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes. And that’s all it was, just empowerment, and information, empowerment with knowledge. No meals were provided, the intervention group was merely informed about the benefits of plant- based living and encouraged to fit it into their own lives at home. No significant change in the control group, but the plant-based intervention group, even though there were no restrictions on portions and being able to eat freely all the healthy foods they wanted, lost an average of nineteen pounds by the end of the three-month study. Nineteen pounds is a respectable weight loss, but what happened next? At the end of those twelve weeks, class was dismissed, and no more instruction was given. The researchers were curious to see how much weight the subjects had gained back after being released from the study. So, everyone was invited back at the six-month mark to get re-weighed. The plant-based group had left the three-month study nineteen pounds lighter on average. But, six months later they were only down about… twenty-seven pounds! They got better. The plant-based group had been feeling so good both physically and mentally… and had been able to come off so many of their medications, that they were sticking to the diet on their own and the weight continued to come off. What about a year later? Even in studies that last a whole year, where people are coached to stay on a particular diet for the entire years’ time, by the end of the year, any initial weight lost typically tends to creep on back. The BROAD study only lasted three months, yet after it was all over, those who had been randomized to the plant-based group not only lost dozens of pounds, but they kept it off. They not only achieved greater weight loss at six and twelve months than any other comparable trial— that was months after the study had already ended! A whole food, plant-based diet achieved the greatest weight loss ever recorded compared to any other such intervention published in the scientific literature. You can read the record-breaking study yourself for free, in full, at nature.com/articles/nutd20173 or you can just point your phone camera up at the screen and pick off the QR code. Any diet that results in reduced calorie intake can result in weight loss. Dropping pounds isn’t so much the issue. The problem is keeping them off. A key difference between plant-based nutrition and more traditional approaches to weight loss is that people are encouraged, on plant-based diets, to eat ad libitum, meaning eat as much as they want. No calorie counting, no portion control—just eating. The strategy is to improve the quality of the food rather than restricting the quantity of the food. If you put people on a diet packed with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans and allow them to eat as much as they want, they end up eating about 50% fewer calories than they might have otherwise. Just as full on half the calories. How can you keep people satisfied cutting more than a thousand calories from their daily diet? By eating more high-bulk, low-calorie-density foods (vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and beans) and fewer calorie-dense foods, like meats, cheeses, sugars, and fats. But it may not just be the calories-in side of the equation; those eating more plant-based appear to effectively be burning more calories in their sleep. The resting metabolic rate of those eating more plant-based may be 10% higher, or more; a boosted metabolism that can translate into burning off hundreds of extra calories a day more without doing a thing. Eating more plant-based you burn more calories just existing. So, no wonder why those who eat more plant-based tend to be slimmer. Start packing your diet with real foods that grow out of the ground, and the pounds should come off naturally, taking you down towards your ideal weight. OK, so that’s what I spent the first half of the book doing, laying out the optimum weight-loss diet, “Plant Yourself.” Then I spend the second half of the book on all the tools I unearthed to drive further weight loss for any stubborn pounds that remain. We already learned that a calorie is not necessarily a calorie. A hundred calories of chickpeas have a different impact than a hundred calories of chicken or Chiclets, based on factors like absorption and appetite, but in the second half I go a step further and explore how even the exact same foods eaten differently can have different effects. Even if you eat the same amount, even if you absorb the same amount, a calorie may still not be a calorie. It’s not only what we eat, but how and when. Just to give you a taste, the exact same number of calories at breakfast are significantly less fattening than the same number of calories at dinner. What?! That’s just mind-blowing. Same calories, different weight loss. A diet with a bigger breakfast causes more weight loss than the same diet with a bigger dinner. So, my recommendation to stop eating after 7 PM is not just because, you know, I’m afraid people are mindlessly snacking on the couch or something. The same snack at night is literally more fattening than eating the exact same snack during the daytime, all thanks to our circadian rhythms, our “Chronobiology.” Something I spend a whole chapter on. Some of the sleep data is really crazy too. Overweight adults were randomized to eight weeks of either a calorie-restricted diet or the same diet combined with five days a week of just one less hour of sleep a night. Now, they ended up sleeping an hour later on the weekends. So, overall, they just cut three hours of sleep out of their week. Now, surely 3 hours a week of sleep difference is not going to change how much weight they lost, right? And on the scale that was true. But in the normal sleep group, 80% of the weight loss was fat, whereas in the group missing just a few hours of sleep, it was the opposite, with 80% of the loss being lean body mass. So, you snooze you lose—fat! A few hours of missed sleep seemed to totally flip fat loss on its head, but just looking at the scale you wouldn’t know it. It’s like when people fast. Stopping eating completely for a week or two can cause more weight loss than just restricting your calories, but paradoxically, it may actually lead to less loss of body fat. Wait, how can eating fewer calories lead to less fat loss? Because during fasting your body starts cannibalizing itself and burning your own protein for fuel. The scale made it look as though they were doing better when they were fasting, but the reality is they were doing worse. They would have lost more body fat if they had kept eating; they would have lost more body fat, eating more calories. Short-term fasting can interfere with body fat loss, not accelerate it, and you see the same thing, with the keto diet. Body fat loss actually slows down when you switch to a ketogenic diet. Just looking at the bathroom scale, though, the keto diet seems like a smashing success, losing less than a pound a week on a regular diet to boom—three-and-a-half pounds in seven days after switching to keto, but what was happening inside their bodies told a totally different story. On the ketogenic diet, their rate of body fat loss was slowed by more than half; so, most of what they were losing was water, but they were also losing protein, they were also losing lean mass. That may help explain why the leg muscles of CrossFit trainees placed on a ketogenic diet can shrink as much as 8% within two months. Of course, even if keto diets worked, the point of weight loss is not to fit into a skinnier casket. People whose diets even tend to trend that way appear to significantly shorten their lives. On the other hand, even just drifting in the direction of eating more healthy plant foods is associated with living longer. Those going the other way, though, those who start out more plant-based but then add meat to their diet at least once a week not only appear to double or triple their odds of diabetes, stroke, heart disease, and weight gain, but may also suffer an associated 3.6-year drop in life expectancy. That’s going from no meat to just once-a-week meat or more. Low-carb diets have been shown to impair artery function and worsen heart disease. Whereas, whole food, plant- based diets have been shown to actually reverse heart disease – that’s what Ornish used. So, what appears to be the most effective weight-loss diet just so happens to be the only diet ever proven to reverse heart disease in the majority of patients. If my grandma didn’t have to die like that, no one’s grandma has to die like that. If that’s all a plant-based diet could do—reverse the number-one killer of men and women, shouldn’t that be the default diet until proven otherwise? And the fact that it can also be so effective in treating, arresting, or reversing other leading killers, like type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure, would seem to make the case for plant-based eating simply overwhelming. Only one diet has ever been shown to do all that: a diet centered around whole plant foods. You don’t have to mortgage your health to lose weight. The single healthiest diet also appears to be the most effective diet for weight loss. After all, permanent weight loss requires permanent dietary changes— healthier habits just have to become a way of life. And if it’s going to be life-long, you want it to lead to a long life. Thankfully, the single best diet proven for weight loss may just so happen to be the safest, cheapest way to eat, for the longest, healthiest life. Thank you.')]","Foods that can help with both weight loss and sustained energy typically include those that are high in fiber, have a low energy density, and are rich in nutrients. Here are some of the best options:

1. **Whole Grains**: Foods like oats, brown rice, and whole wheat provide complex carbohydrates that are digested slowly, offering sustained energy without causing rapid spikes in blood sugar. They are also high in fiber, which can help with weight management by making you feel fuller for longer.

2. **Legumes**: Beans, lentils, chickpeas, and other legumes are excellent sources of protein and fiber. They help in maintaining satiety, managing blood sugar levels, and providing steady energy.

3. **Fruits and Vegetables**: Most fruits and vegetables are low in calories and high in fiber and water, making them ideal for weight loss. They also provide vitamins and minerals that support overall health and energy levels. For example, bananas are known for their potassium content, which helps in maintaining nerve and muscle function.

4. **Nuts and Seeds**: While they are higher in calories, nuts and seeds are rich in healthy fats, proteins, and fiber. They can be very satiating, helping to control hunger over long periods. Almonds, chia seeds, and flaxseeds are particularly good choices.

5. **Lean Proteins**: Incorporating lean protein sources like chicken, turkey, fish, and plant-based alternatives can help in maintaining muscle mass during weight loss and provide sustained energy. Proteins take longer to digest, which helps in prolonging satiety.

6. **Dairy or Dairy Alternatives**: Low-fat dairy products or plant-based alternatives that are fortified with calcium and vitamin D can also be beneficial. They provide protein and can be a good part of a weight management diet.

Incorporating these foods into a balanced diet can help manage weight and provide the energy needed throughout the day. It's also important to combine these dietary choices with regular physical activity for optimal health and weight management.","Foods that can help with both weight loss and sustained energy typically include those that are high in fiber, have a low energy density, and are rich in nutrients.

To snack or not to snack? A review was recently published on the accumulated research about eating frequency, and both weight and health. Maybe we should eat throughout the day, to reduce hunger, increase our metabolic rate, mobilize our body fat. Or, maybe, snacking will just lead us to overeat. What does the science say? What do you think? A few big meals a day, or smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day, for weight management and optimal health? According to the best available science, it doesn’t seem to matter. “Overall current evidence does not suggest that manipulating eating frequency greatly benefits weight and health.” What we eat is more important than how often we eat it. If you do like snacking, though, a new study, thanks to the California Prune Board, suggests that (what else?) prunes may be a particularly good choice, given the “satiating power of prunes”— which they found, like with nuts, to compensate for the majority of their calories.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Energy density explains how a study can show participants lose an average of 17 pounds within 21 days while eating a greater quantity of food.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Three apples or three pears a day as snacks between meals on top of whatever else they were eating. Fruit is low in calories, but not zero, so if you add food to people’s diets, even healthy foods won’t they gain weight? No, they lost a couple pounds. Maybe it was all that fiber? If you remember, we learned our gut bacteria can create anti-obesity compounds from fiber, that’s why they had also had a cookie group. Three apples, three pears, or three cookies with enough oats in them to have about the same amount of fiber as the fruit. Despite the fiber, adding cookies to one’s diet does not lead to weight loss. They think the weight- reducing secret of fruit is it’s low energy density, meaning you get a lot of food for just a few calories, and so it fills you up. Energy density is a relatively new concept that has been identified as an important factor in body weight control in both adults and in children and adolescents. Energy density is defined as the amount of calories per unit weight of a food or beverage. Water, for example, provides a significant amount of weight without adding calories. Fiber too. Thus, foods high in  fiber and water are generally lower in energy density. On the other hand, because dietary fat provides the greatest amount of calories per unit weight, foods high in fat are generally high in energy density. The CDC offers some examples. High energy density foods are like bacon— lots of calories in a small package. A medium energy density food is like a bagel, and low density foods are typified by fruits and vegetables. In general, the lower the better, with two exceptions. Soda is so heavy that by energy density it looks less harmful than it is. And nuts have so much fat they appear less healthy than they are. Otherwise, though, the science supports a relationship between energy density and body weight, such that consuming diets lower in energy density may be an effective strategy for weight control. This is because people tend to eat a consistent weight of food, so when there’s less calories per pound, calorie intake is reduced. A small drop in energy density can lead to a small drop in weight, and the greater the decrease in energy density the greater the weight loss. Energy density can be reduced in a variety of ways such as the addition of vegetables or fruits to recipes or by lowering the fat or sugar content. And indeed that’s how we evolved, eating predominantly low energy density foods such as fruits, vegetables, plants and tubers, starch-filled roots like sweet potatoes. The first study to emphasize how fruits and vegetables could affect energy density and food intake was conducted more than 30 years ago. Researchers were able to cut people’s caloric intake nearly in half, from 3000 calories a day down to 1570 without cutting portions, just by substituting less calorie dense foods, which means lots of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans, compared to a high energy density meal with lots of meat and sugar. Nearly half the calories, but they enjoyed the meals just as much. They tried this in Hawaii, putting folks on a traditional Hawaiian diet with all the plant foods they could eat. They lost an average of 17 pounds in just 21 days, resulting in better cholesterol, triglycerides, blood sugars, and blood pressure. Caloric intake dropped 40%, but not by eating less food. In fact they lost 17 pounds in 21 days eating more food- four pounds of food. But because plants tend to be so calorically dilute, one can stuff oneself without getting the same kind of weight gain. And the energy density of foods is of interest for weight management not only because it allows people to eat satisfying portions while limiting calories, but also because reductions in energy density are associated with improved dietary quality. For example, lower energy dense diets are associated with lower risk of pancreatic cancer. Lower energy dense diets tend to be of healthier foods, so we get the best of both worlds.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Energy density explains how a study can show participants lose an average of 17 pounds within 21 days while eating a greater quantity of food.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Should we be concerned that eating dried fruit may make us fat? Remember that fig study I covered, that added 14 figs to people’s daily diets? Surprisingly, that did not lead to significant weight gain. Wait a second. That’s 300 calories of figs a day. Over five weeks, that’s 10,000 calories. Did they disappear into thin air? No. Figs are so packed with fiber, and satiating, that even without trying, people just ended up eating less of other foods throughout the day. I get full just thinking about eating 14 figs a day. Was this just a fluke, though? Let’s look at those other new studies. What about adding three-quarters of a cup of dried apples to your diet, every day, for a year? 200 extra calories a day— but no significant change in weight. 200 extra calories of prunes a day, for a year? No significant change in weight. And, the same thing with a month of a daily 300-calorie load of dates. In general, the 5-10% of Americans that average a tablespoon or more of dried fruit a day tend to be less overweight, less obese, have a slimmer waist, and less abdominal obesity. They tended to eat more, but yet weighed less. Similar findings were found for those that eat nuts or nut butters— lower body mass index, and a slimmer waist. In past videos, I’ve explored the potential mechanisms, right? Nuts are filling, may boost metabolism, and may end up flushing some of their fat down the toilet. What if you put them both together? What would be the effect of adding daily fruit and nut bars on top of one’s regular diet, for two months? Took about a hundred folks who were overweight, randomized into two groups. Half ate their regular diet, and the other half ate their regular diet, plus two fruit and nut bars a day, totaling an extra 340 calories. But these weren’t candy calories; these were largely whole plant food calories— dried fruits and nuts. Two daily fruit and nut bars for two months did not cause weight gain. And, they had extra sugar in them. Maybe that’s why cholesterol didn’t get better, despite the nuts, which should have helped. “Recipes with…less sugar…might be expected to improve lipid profiles.” So, that’s brands, you know, like this.

That\'s why your 10th bite of chocolate, for example, doesn\'t taste as good as the first bite. We have a built-in biological drive to get us to keep changing up our foods, so we\'ll be more likely to hit all of our nutritional requirements. The drive is so powerful that even imagined consumption reduces actual consumption. If you have someone imagine they\'re eating cheese, for example, over and over, and then you give them actual cheese, they eat less of it than those who hadn\'t been imagining they were eating cheese. Ironically, habituation may be one of the reasons fad ""mono diets"" like the cabbage soup diet and the oatmeal diet, or meal replacement shakes can actually result in better adherence and lower ratings of hunger compared to less restrictive diets. In the landmark study ""A Satiety Index of Common Foods,"" in which dozens of foods were put to the test, boiled potatoes were found to be the most satiating food. 240 calories of boiled potatoes were found to be more satisfying in terms of quelling hunger than the same number of calories of any other food tested. No other food even came close. No doubt potatoes\' low-calorie density played a role. For people to eat 240 calories of spuds, the researchers had to feed them nearly a pound of potatoes, compared to just a few cookies, for example, but that\'s kind of the point. They had to feed people even more apples, grapes, and oranges, though, yet each fruit was still about 40% less satiating than the potatoes. So, an all-potato diet would probably take the gold—the Yukon gold—for the most bland, monotonous, and satiating diet. Mono diets, where you just eat one thing, are the poster child for unsustainability however, and thank heavens for that. Over time they can lead to serious nutrient deficiencies, like blindness from vitamin A deficiency in the case of white potatoes. The satiating power of potatoes can still be brought to bear, though. Boiled potatoes beat out rice and pasta in terms of a satiating side dish, cutting as much as about 200 calories of intake off a meal. Compared to boiled and mashed potatoes, French fries or even baked ones do not appear to have the same satiating impact. To exploit habituation for weight loss while maintaining nutrient abundance, you could limit the variety of unhealthy foods you eat, while expanding the variety of healthy foods. In that way you can simultaneously take advantage of the appetite suppressing effects of monotony while diversifying your fruit and vegetable portfolio. Studies have shown that a greater variety of calorie dense foods like sweets and snacks are associated with excess body fat, but a greater vegetable variety appeared protective. Presented with a greater variety of fruit, a greater variety of vegetables, and greater variety of vegetable seasonings, people may consume a greater quantity, crowding out less healthy options. For the first 20 years of the official Dietary Guidelines for Americans, they recommended generally eating a variety of foods. In the new millennium they\'ve started getting more precise, specifying a diversity of healthier foods only. As a pair of Harvard and NYU dietitians concluded in a paper on dietary variety as an overlooked strategy for obesity and chronic disease control, ""Choose and prepare a greater variety of plant-based foods,"" recognizing that a greater variety of less healthy options could be counterproductive. So, how can we respond to industry attempts to lure us into temptation by turning our natural biological drives against us? Should we never eat really delicious food? No, but it may help to recognize the effects hyperpalatable foods can have on hijacking our appetites and undermining our bodies better judgment. We can also use some of those same primitive impulses to our advantage by monotonizing our choices of the bad and diversifying our choices of the good. In ""How Not to Diet"" I call it ""Meatball Monotony and Veggie Variety."" Try picking out a new fruit or vegetable every time you shop. In my own family\'s home, we always have a wide array of healthy snacks on hand to entice the finickiest of tastes. The contrasting collage of colors and shapes in fruit baskets and vegetable platters beat out boring bowls of a single fruit because they make you want to mix it up and try a little of each. And with different healthy dipping sauces, the possibilities are endless.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

This is the fourth of a seven-video series on the fascinating phenomenon of the mystery of the missing calories—why don't nuts make us fat? I reviewed the balance of evidence in Nuts and Obesity: The Weight of Evidence (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/nuts-and-obesity-the-weight-of-evidence/) and introduced two theories on Monday (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/solving-the-mystery-of-the-missing-calories/), both of which were not well supported by a study on peanut butter I detailed in yesterday's video-of-the-day (http://nutritionfacts.org/video/testing-the-pistachio-principle/).

So, if researchers add a handful of nuts to our daily diet, totaling 200 calories, and they were just so filling that it displaced 200 calories of something else we would have normally eaten, then that could explain how, you know, one can remain in energy balance— even though they just added a calorically dense food, like nuts, to one’s daily diet. And hey, if you felt so satisfied you unintentionally ended up eating 250 calories less each day, then that could explain why, in a few of the nut studies, people actually lost weight. Recently, they tested walnuts. “It has been proposed, mainly on the basis of observational studies, that nuts may provide superior satiation, may lead to reduced calorie consumption,… but evidence from randomized, interventional studies is lacking.” Until now. They double-blinded the study by disguising the walnuts in a smoothie. “The walnut-containing liquid meal contained…walnuts,…frozen mango, …frozen strawberries,…banana, …frozen berries, and…pineapple juice.” Sounds good. Whereas the placebo liquid meal contained oil, mango, strawberries, banana, berries, and juice, and “40 drops of walnut flavoring.” In fact, they made it so you literally couldn’t tell the difference, in blind taste tests. And, they were made with the exact same number of calories. So, if there was nothing special about nuts, then you should feel just as satiated either way. But, no. After a few days on the placebo, the walnut-flavored smoothie people just felt something was missing. Everyone drank their smoothies at breakfast, and then, right before lunch, the folks that didn’t get the real nuts felt significantly less full, less satiated— even after the no-chewing and full-fat absorption. So, you can see how if you had nuts for breakfast, you may very well unintentionally eat a smaller lunch than you otherwise would— and so, in this way, nuts could actually decrease daily caloric consumption.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Understanding the metabolic and behavioral adaptations that slow weight loss\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

So when we start losing weight, we may unconsciously start moving less as a behavioral adaptation to conserve energy. There are metabolic adaptations as well. Our metabolism slows down. Every pound of weight loss may reduce our resting metabolic rate by seven calories a day. This may only translate to a few percent differences for most, but can rapidly snowball for those who achieve massive weight loss. During one session, some of The Biggest Loser contestants famously had their metabolic rates tracked. Above and beyond the hundreds of calories less it takes to just exist 100+ pounds lighter, by the end of the season their metabolic rates slowed by an extra 500 calories a day. The mindblower was that six years later they were retested and still had the 500-calorie-a-day handicap. So the contestants had to cut 500 calories more than anyone else their size to maintain the same weight loss. No wonder the bulk of their weight was regained. Most remained at least 10% lower than their starting weight, though, and even a 7% drop has been shown to cut diabetes rates about in half. Still, the metabolic slowing means you have to work that much harder than everyone else just to stay in place. Analyzing four seasons of The Biggest Loser, minute-by-minute, researchers noted that 85% of the focus was on exercise rather than diet, though the exercise component accounted for less than half of the weight loss. Even six years after their season ended, the contestants had been maintaining an hour of daily, vigorous exercise, yet still regained most of the weight. Why? Because they  started eating more. They could have  cut their exercise to just 20 minutes a day and still maintained 100% of their initial weight loss if they would have just been able to keep their intake to under 3,000 calories a day. That may not sound like much of a challenge, but weight loss doesn\'t just slow your metabolism; it boosts your appetite. If it were just a matter of your weight settling at the point at which your reduced calorie intake matches your reduced calorie output, it would take years for your weight loss to plateau. Instead, it often happens within six to eight months. You may know the drill: Start the diet, stick to the diet, and then weight loss stalls six months later. What happened? Don\'t blame your metabolism; that just plays a small part. What happened is that you likely actually stopped sticking to your diet because your appetite went on a rampage. Let\'s break it down. If you cut 800 calories out of your daily diet— 2600 calories a day down to 1800— and your weight loss stalls after six months, then what happened is that at the end of the first month you think you\'re still cutting 800 calories, but you may actually only be down about 600 calories a day. By month two you\'re only down about 500, month three, 300, and by month six you\'re only eating 200 calories less than before you went on the diet. In other words, you inadvertently suffered an exponential increase in calorie intake over those six months. Yet you may not even realize it, because by that time your body may have ramped your appetite up 600 calories. So, it still feels as if you are eating 800 calories less, but it\'s actually only 200. Since an 800 calorie drop in intake may slow your metabolism and physical activity about 200 calories a day, with no difference between Calories In and Calories Out at six months, no wonder your weight loss grinds to a complete halt. The slow upward drift in calorie intake on a new diet is not because you got lazy. Once your appetite is boosted by 600 calories after dieting for a while, eating 200 calories less at the end is as hard as eating 800 calories less at the beginning. So you can maintain the same disciplined level of willpower and self-control and still end up stagnating. To prevent this from happening, you need to maintain the calorie deficit. How is that possible in the face of a ravenous appetite? Hunger is a biological drive. Asking someone to eat smaller portions is like asking someone to take fewer breaths. You can white-knuckle it for a bit, but eventually nature wins out. That\'s why I wrote How Not to Diet. There are foods that can counter the slowing of our metabolism and suppress our appetite, ways of eating to counter the behavioral adaptation and even eat more food yet still lose weight. Due to the metabolic slowing and increased appetite that accompanies weight loss, sustained weight loss requires a persistent calorie deficit of 300 to 500 calories a day. This can be accomplished without reducing portion sizes simply by lowering the calorie density of meals. This can result in the rare combination of weight loss with both an increase in quality and even quantity of food consumed. I\'m going to do a whole series of videos about it.

But who eats just one meal a day? What about just shifting our daily distribution of calories earlier in the day? Israeli researchers randomized overweight and obese women into one of two “isocaloric” groups, meaning each group was given the same number of total calories. One group was given a 700-calorie breakfast, a 500-calorie lunch, and a 200-calorie dinner; and the other group was given the opposite, 200 for breakfast, 500 for lunch, and 700 for dinner. Since they were all eating the same number of calories overall, the king-prince-pauper group should have lost the same amount of weight as the pauper- prince-king group, right? But no, the morning-slanted group lost more than twice as much weight, in addition to slimming about an extra two inches off their waistlines. By the end of the 12-week study, the king-prince-pauper group lost 11 more pounds (19 pounds lost compared to 8 despite eating the same number of calories). That’s the power of chronobiology, the power of our circadian rhythm. … 700, 500, 200 is 50% of calories at breakfast, 36% of calories at lunch, and only 14% of calories at supper. That’s pretty skewed. What about 20% for supper instead, a 50%-30%-20% spread, compared to 20-30-50? Again, the bigger breakfast group experienced “dramatically increased” weight loss, about nine pounds different in just eight weeks with no significant differences in overall calorie intake or physical activity between the two groups. Instead of 80%+ of calories at breakfast and lunch, what about 70% compared to 55%? Overweight “homemakers” were randomized to eat 70% of their calories at breakfast, a morning snack, and lunch, leaving 30% for an afternoon snack and dinner, or a more balanced 55% up through and including lunch. In both cases only a minority of calories were eaten for dinner. Would it matter if it was just 55% up through lunch or 70%? Yes, significantly more weight loss and slimming in the dietary pattern that was even more biased towards the morning. “Stories about food and nutrition are in the news on an almost daily basis, but information can sometimes be confusing and contradictory. Clear messages should be proposed in order to reach the greatest number of people,” the researchers conclude. And one clear communication physicians could give is “If you want to lose weight, eat more in the morning than in the evening.” Even just telling people to eat their main meal at lunch rather than dinner may help. Despite comparable calorie intakes, participants in a weight loss program randomized to get advice to make their main meal lunch, beat out those who instead were told to make their main meal dinner. The proverb “Eat breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince, and dinner like a pauper” evidently has another variant: “Eat breakfast yourself, share lunch with a friend, and give dinner away to your enemy.” I wouldn’t go that far, but there does appear to be metabolic benefit to front loading the bulk of your calories earlier in the day. The evidence isn’t completely consistent, though. A review of dietary pattern studies questioned the role that reducing evening intakes would facilitate weight loss, citing this study that showed the evening-weighted group did better than the heavy morning meal group. Perhaps that was because the morning meal group was given for breakfast “chocolate, cookies, cake, ice cream, chocolate mousse and donuts.” So, chronobiology can be trumped by a junk food methodology. Overall, the “what” is still more important than the “when.” Caloric timing may be used to accelerate weight loss but doesn’t substitute for a healthy diet. When he said there was a time for every purpose under heaven, Ecclesiastes probably wasn’t talking about donuts.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""How many fewer calories should you eat to lose one pound of body fat?

Raisins, like all fruits, have  a variety of health benefits,  but dried fruit is higher in  calories per serving than fresh,  so might they contribute to weight gain?  This study helped set people’s minds at ease.  Men and women assigned to consume  a cup of raisins a day for six weeks  evidently offset the consumption  of other foods in their diets  such that they experienced no significant  change in weight or waist circumference.  What about in kids? Leave it to the California Raisin Marketing  Board to dream up a study like this.  An after-school snack of raisins lowers  cumulative food intake in young children.  Sounds good, right?  But that’s compared to potato  chips and chocolate chip cookies.  They gave kids raisins,  grapes, chips, or cookies  and said they could eat as  much as they wanted and,  surprise, surprise: kids ate  less fruit and more junk,  but I guess naming the paper  “Kids Prefer Cookies”  would not have garnered  the same kind of marketing  board sponsor support. Reminds me of this study they did.  Regular consumption of raisins  may reduce blood sugar levels— compared to fudge cookies and Oreos.  Or how about this one:  raisins were found to cause  less of a blood sugar spike  than Coca Cola and candy bars.  Though you can tell it was not funded   by Big Raisin by their conclusion:  Whether the general public should  be advised to snack on fruit  rather than on candy bars requires  further debate and investigation.  Guess who funded that one? Comparing raisins to chips and  cookies was similarly unhelpful.  This is the study I was expecting.  Nine to eleven year old boys and girls  were told to eat all the grapes or raisins  they wanted 30 minutes before a meal in which  they could eat all the pizza they wanted.  If you just gave them the meal, no snack,   they ate 837 calories worth of pizza.  If you gave them all-you-can-eat grapes before  the meal, they ate 128 calories of grapes,  but that seemed to fill them up a bit   so they ended up eating less pizza.  But because they ate the snack and the meal,  they ended up getting more calories over all.  Still, grape calories are certainly better  than pizza calories, but check this out.  When given raisins instead, they  ate even more snack calories,  but the raisins were evidently  so satiating, so filling  that they ate so much less pizza  that they ate fewer calories over all.  Now I know as parents there’s a concern that if  our kids eat snacks it might spoil their dinner,  but when the snacks are fruit, and the  meal is a pepperoni and 3-cheese pizza,  the more we can ruin their appetite, the better.')]","For someone on a weight loss journey looking to stay full and energized during afternoon energy dips, snacks that are high in fiber and have a low energy density can be particularly effective. Based on Dr. Michael Greger's insights from the provided transcripts, here are some recommended snacks:

1. **Fruits**: Fresh fruits like apples, pears, and grapes are excellent choices. They are low in calories but high in fiber and water, which helps in feeling full and satiated. For instance, the study mentioned in the transcripts showed that eating apples or pears as snacks helped individuals lose weight.

2. **Nuts**: Despite their caloric density, nuts are very satiating and do not necessarily lead to expected weight gain. Nuts like almonds, walnuts, and pistachios can help suppress appetite, potentially leading to reduced calorie intake throughout the day.

3. **Dried Fruits**: Prunes and raisins are specifically mentioned as good snack options. They are packed with fiber and have a strong satiating effect, which can help control hunger without contributing to weight gain. For example, adding prunes to one's diet did not lead to significant weight gain even with their higher calorie content, thanks to their high fiber content and satiating power.

4. **Vegetables**: Raw vegetables like carrots, celery, and bell peppers are low in calories and high in fiber. They can be paired with hummus or a low-calorie dip to enhance flavor without adding too many extra calories.

5. **Whole Grains**: Snacks like air-popped popcorn or whole-grain crackers can be good options. They provide fiber and bulk, which can help keep you full.

Choosing snacks that are not only filling but also nutritious can help manage hunger and provide sustained energy, which is crucial during a weight loss journey.","For someone on a weight loss journey looking to stay full and energized during afternoon energy dips, snacks that are high in fiber and have a low energy density can be particularly effective.

Stick your hand out, thumbs up, feel for the knobby bone  at the top of your wrist.

If you lightly feel between the  knobby bone and that first tendon, you should feel your pulse. Got it? Okay, now we’re going  to feel what happens to our pulse when we take a deep breath.

You should have felt your pulse  speed up when you breathe in and slow down when you breathe out -- that’s called heart rate variability, and it’s a very good thing. That’s a measure of the control  our nerves have over our heart. This is the survival curve for  people after a heart attack.

It’s got strong advantages. Taking one’s pulse is cheap, takes little time, it’s understandable to people, and it’s something everyone can do at home to measure their progress to become an active participant in their own health management. Every ten beats per minute increase is associated with a 10 to 20% increase in the risk of death. There seems to be a continuous increase in risk with increasing heart rate, at least for values above about a beat a second. So we can just look at our watch and if our heart is beating faster than the seconds go by— even when we’re sitting quietly, then we have to do something about it, especially when we start getting up around 80 or 90. Men with no apparent heart disease evidence with a pulse of 90 may have five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death— meaning their first symptom is their last— compared to those down the safety zone. Living up around 90 increases heart disease risk at a level similar to smoking. If you ask most doctors, though, 90 is considered normal. The accepted limits of heartrate have long been set at 60 and 100 beats/min. How did they come up with that? It was adopted as a matter of convenience just based on the scale of the squares on EKG paper. A historical accident like the QWERTY keyboard that just became the norm. 60 to 100 doesn’t even represent the bell curve. These cardiologists measured the heart rate of 500 people and concluded that 45 to 95 was a better definition of normal, rounding to 50 to 90, which a survey of leading cardiologists concurred with. Now we know that normal doesn’t necessarily mean optimal, but doctors shouldn’t be telling people with heart rates in the 50’s that they\'re are too low; in fact they may be right where they should be. Certainly a heart rate higher than 80 should ring an alarm bell, but what can we do about it? Exercise is one obvious possibility. Ironically, you make the heart go faster so that that the rest of the time your heart beats slower. The public health benefits of physical exercise, especially for heart protection, are widely accepted, and among the many biological mechanisms proposed to account for this risk-reducing effect is autonomic nervous system regulation of the heart. That’s your brain’s ability to slow down the resting beat of our heart. If you put people through a 12 week aerobic conditioning program of cycling, stairmaster, and running on a treadmill, you can drop their resting heart rate down from about 69 to about 66, so three beats per minute drop. Of course you have to keep it up; stop exercising and your resting heart rate goes right back up. Exercise is just one way to drop our heartrate, though. The way to our heart may also be through our stomach. What if instead of three months of exercise, you did three months of beans? A cup a day of beans, chickpeas, or lentils. The first randomized controlled trial of beans for the treatment of diabetes. And indeed successfully improved blood sugar control dropping A1C levels from 7.4 to 6.9, but this was also the first study to ever assess the effect of bean consumption on heart rate. And indeed one of the few to determine the effect on heartrate of any dietary intervention. This is particularly important in diabetics since having a higher resting heart rate not only increases the risk of death just like everybody else, but also appears to predict greater risk of diabetic complications, such as damage to the nerves and eyes. So how did beans do? A 3.4 beat drop in heartrate— just as much as the 250 hours on a treadmill. We’re not sure why beans are as powerful as exercise in bringing down one’s resting heart rate. In addition to the potential direct beneficial effects of all the good stuff in legumes, there is also the potential displacement value of reducing some of the animal protein foods by eating so many beans instead.

Thousands of papers have been published on the important topic of what determines people’s happiness and psychological health, but what about the potential influence of the different kinds of foods that people eat? The rising prevalence of mental ill health is causing a considerable burden, and so inexpensive and effective strategies are required to improve the psychological well-being of our population. And now we have a growing body of literature suggesting that dietary intake may have the potential to influence psychological well-being. Dietary intake of what? Well, given the strong evidence base for the health benefits of fruits and vegetables, researchers started there. Cross-sectional studies from all over the world support this relationship between happiness and fruit and vegetable intake. Those eating fruits and vegetables each day had a higher likelihood of being classified as “very happy"", suggesting a strong and positive correlation between fruit and vegetable consumption and happiness. Perhaps feelings of optimism, too. The largest such study was done in Great Britain, where a dose–response relationship was found between daily servings of fruits and vegetables and both life satisfaction and happiness, meaning more fruits and veggies meant more happiness. People who got up to seven or eight servings a day reported the highest life satisfaction and happiness. And these associations remained significant even after controlling for factors such as income and illness and exercise, smoking and body weight, suggesting fruit and vegetable consumption wasn’t just acting as a marker for other healthy behaviors. But how could eating plants improve happiness on their own? Well, many fruits and veggies contain higher levels of vitamin C, which is a co-factor in the production of dopamine, the “zest for life” neurotransmitter. And the antioxidants reduce inflammation, which may lead to higher levels of eudaemonic well-being. Aristotle\'s notion of eudaemonia, described as the highest of all human goods, the realization of one\'s true potential, which was the aim of this study. They wanted to know whether eating fruit and vegetables was associated with other markers of well-being beyond happiness and life satisfaction, like greater eudaemonic well-being – a state of flourishing characterized by feelings of engagement, meaning, and purpose in life. So a sample of about 400 young adults were followed for about two weeks and indeed young adults who ate more fruit and veggies reported higher average eudaemonic well-being, more intense feelings of curiosity, and greater creativity. And they could follow this on a day by day basis— greater well-being on the days they ate healthier. These findings suggest that  fruit and vegetable intake is related to other aspects of human flourishing, beyond just feeling happy. Not so fast, though. Instead of eating good food leading to a good mood, maybe the good mood led to eating good food. Experimentally, if you put people in a good mood, they rate healthy foods like apples higher than indulgent foods like candy bars. Given a choice between M&M’s and grapes, individuals in a positive mood were more likely to choose the grapes. The results of these studies lend support to a growing body of research that suggests that positive mood facilitates resistance to temptation. Who needs comfort food when you’re already comforted? It’s like which came first, the chicken or the egg? Yes, eating eggs can increase our likelihood of chronic disease, but maybe chronic disease also increases our likelihood of eating unhealthy foods. Which came first, the mood or the food? What we need is a study like this, but instead of looking at well-being and diet on the same day, you see if there’s a correlation between what you eat today, and how you feel tomorrow. But we didn’t have a study like that… until now. They found the same strong relationships between daily positive mood and fruit and vegetable consumption, but lagged analyses showed that fruit and vegetable consumption predicted improvements in positive mood the next day, not vice versa. On days when people ate more fruits and vegetables, they reported feeling calmer, happier, and more energetic than they normally do, and they also felt more positive the next day. So, eating fruit and vegetables really may promote emotional well-being. Look, single bouts of exercise can elevate one’s mood, why not the same thing with healthy food? How many fruits and vegetables? Seems we need to consume approximately 7.2 daily servings of fruit or 8.2 servings of vegetables to notice a meaningful change.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Certain foods are linked not only to increased happiness, but also to greater “eudaemonic” well-being—feelings of engagement, creativity, meaning, and purpose in life.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Why were vegetarians significantly less  depressed, anxious, and stressed than even healthy meat  eaters in the study? Negligible arachidonic acid  intake may help explain the favorable mood profile  observed with vegetarian diets. As I talked about last year, this arachidonic acid stuff in our diet produces inflammatory compounds  which may inflame our brain. The omnivores ate 9 times as much  arachidonic acid than the vegetarians, which is not surprising, given that  arachidonic acid is not found in plants. That’s why vegetarians and vegans  have significantly lower levels of arachidonic acid flowing  though their bloodstream. In fact, you can even  measure it right out of saliva. They found significantly lower levels  of arachidonic acid in vegetarian drool. This was a landmark study, but it was also just a cross- sectional study, a snapshot in time. To prove cause and effect they really  needed to do an interventional study. So they did! Presented at the American Public  Health Association conference, they took a bunch of meat eaters  and split them up into three groups. The control group maintained  regular intake of flesh foods. The second group ate  fish, but no other meat, and the third was put on a  vegetarian diet with no eggs. The whole study only lasted two weeks, but what do you think they found? If it was primarily the saturated fat  inflaming the omnivores\' brain, then the moods of both the veg and  fish groups would presumably improve. If arachidonic acid was the culprit then presumably only the veg group  would feel significantly better. This is the amount of  arachidonic acid in blue consumed per day by the end of the study. The fish eaters were eating a lot more of those long chain omega 3’s,  though, EPA and DHA, so maybe they were protected even though they were consuming all that arachidonic acid in fish. Or, maybe no one would  experience a change in mood at all in such a short time frame— just two weeks. Sometimes it takes drugs  months to have an effect. Here’s what they found. In terms of psychological benefits, the egg-free vegetarian  group significantly improved, meaning greater reductions in both  the Depression, Anxiety, Stress Scale and the Profile of Mood States-- a measurement of mood disturbance. Though the no-poultry fish group did  marginally better than the control group, the difference was not  statistically significant. Conclusion: The complete  restriction of flesh foods significantly reduced mood  variability in omnivores. Our results suggest  that a vegetarian diet can reduce mood variability in omnivores. Perhaps eating less meat can  help protect mood in omnivores, particularly important in those  susceptible to mood disorders.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Supplements for anxiety.

The question is why? Several different mechanisms have been proposed. For example, it may be the antioxidants and anti-inflammatory properties of produce, scavenging the free radicals that are involved in some of the inflammation associated with depression. If that’s the case, what about just taking vitamin C supplements? The brain has some of the highest levels of vitamin C in the body; so, the thought is if we take extra vitamin C, it may have some sort of therapeutic role in brain diseases, especially given that it’s not just an antioxidant, but also has other critical functions in the brain such as helping to build neurotransmitters like dopamine. But you don’t know whether it actually helps, until you... put it to the test. One study found a beneficial effect of adding vitamin C as an adjunct treatment to an antidepressant, while another study found no benefit from vitamin C supplementation. So, there are mixed results for vitamin C and depression. Here’s another study that found no benefit when it came to depression, but those randomized to vitamin C instead of placebo pills did show a significant decrease in anxiety level. And this wasn’t only seen in this study. The effects of oral vitamin C supplementation on anxiety in students: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. High school students were given 500mg a day or placebo. 500mg of vitamin C is about what you’d find in five oranges, four yellow kiwifruit or guavas, or one and a half yellow bell peppers. Within just two weeks, the vitamin C reduced anxiety compared to placebo, along with providing a significant drop in heart rate. Given these data showing vitamin C may have anxiety-reducing effect, researchers sought to find out if only a single dose could acutely affect emotional states. And indeed, within only two hours of taking some C, subjects experienced a significant drop in anxiety compared to placebo, though only among those who started out the most anxious in the first place. As a bonus, vitamin C supplementation may lower your blood pressure a few points, but whole fruits and vegetables can do the same thing and may even do it better for those who need it the most. As I’ve shown previously, even just adding two servings of fruits and vegetables a day can have psychological well-being benefits within only two weeks. And you won’t be put at risk of kidney stones like you would with vitamin C supplements, though that appears to be only a problem in men.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'The most comprehensive controlled trial of diet and mood finds that a plant-based nutrition program in a workplace setting across ten corporate sites significantly improves depression, anxiety, and productivity.\n\nThis is part of our Flashback Friday series, and originally aired in 2015.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

But out of the 21 studies they could find in the medical literature, they were only able to find one randomized controlled trial, considered the study design that provides the highest level of evidence. And it was the study I profiled in ""Improving Mood Through Diet"", in which removing meat, fish, poultry and eggs improved several mood scores in just two weeks. We\'ve known those eating plant-based tend to have healthier mood states— less tension, anxiety, depression, anger, hostility and fatigue, but you couldn\'t tell if it was cause and effect until you put it to the test, which they finally did. But what could account for such rapid results? Well, eating vegetarian does give you a better antioxidant status, which may help with depression. Also, as I\'ve previously addressed, how consumption of even a single carbohydrate-rich meal can improve depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, fatigue, alertness, and calmness scores among patients with PMS, but what about long term? Overweight men and women were randomized into a low carb, high fat diet or high carb, low fat diet for a year. By the end of the year, who had less depression, anxiety, anger and hostility, feelings of dejection, tension, fatigue, better vigor, less confusion or mood disturbances? The low carb dieters are represented by the black circles, and the low fat dieters are represented in the white. These sustained improvements in mood in the low fat group compared with the low carb group are consistent with results from epidemiological studies showing that diets high in carbohydrate and low in fat and protein are associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression and have beneficial effects on psychological well-being. The overall amount of fat in their diet didn\'t change in this study, though. But the type of fat did. Their arachidonic acid intake fell to zero. Arachidonic acid is an inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid that can adversely impact mental health via a cascade of neuroinflammation. It may inflame our brain. High blood levels in the bloodstream have been associated with a greater likelihood of suicide risk, for example, and major depressive episodes. How can we stay away from the stuff? Well, Americans are exposed to arachidonic acid primarily through chicken and eggs. But when you remove chicken and eggs, and other meat, we can eliminate preformed arachidonic acid from our diet. So while high-quality treatment studies investigating the impact of diet on depression are scarce, there is that successful 2-week trial, but even better: How about 22 weeks? Overweight or diabetic employees of a major insurance corporation received either weekly group instruction on a whole food plant-based diet or no diet instruction for five and a half months. There was no portion size restriction, no calorie counting, no carb counting. No change in exercise. No meals were provided, but the company cafeteria did start offering daily options such as lentil soup, minestrone, bean burritos. No meat, eggs, dairy, oil or junk, yet they reported greater diet satisfaction compared with the control group participants who had no diet restrictions. How\'d they do though? More participants in the plant-based intervention group reported improved digestion, increased energy, better sleep than usual at week 22 compared with the control group. They also reported a significant increase in physical functioning, general health, vitality, and mental health. Here\'s this kind of represented graphically, where the plant-based group beat out controls on nearly every measure. There was also significant improvements in work productivity, thought to be due in large part to their improvements in health. So what this study demonstrated was that a cholesterol-free diet is acceptable, not only in research settings, but in a typical corporate environment, improving quality of life and productivity at little cost. All we need now is a large, randomized trial for confirmation, but we didn\'t have such a thing, until now. Ten corporate sites across the country from San Diego to Macon, Georgia. Same kind of set up as before. Can a plant-based nutrition program in a multi-center, corporate setting improve depression, anxiety, and productivity? Yes. Significant improvements in depression, anxiety, fatigue, emotional well being, and daily functioning. Lifestyle interventions have an increasingly apparent role in physical and mental health, and among the most effective of these is the use of plant-based diets.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'The effects of spinach and berries on oxidative stress, inflammation, and muscle soreness in athletes.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

What about the consumption of fruit and vegetables and risk of frailty in the elderly? Higher fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with lower frailty as well, in a dose-response manner, meaning more fruit less frailty, and more vegetables too, but these were all observational studies, which can’t alone prove cause-and-effect. What happens when you  put foods to the test? Well, no positive influence ingesting chia seed oil on human running performance, but there was an effect found for spinach supplementation on exercise-induced oxidation stress. And by spinach supplementation, they meant they just gave some guys some fresh raw spinach leaves, one gram per kilo, so like a quarter of a bunch a day for two weeks and then they had them  run a half marathon. And, they found that “chronic daily oral supplementation of spinach,” uh meaning like eating a salad, has alleviating effects on known markers of oxidative stress and muscle damage, Here’s what happens when you run a half marathon without spinach: a big spike in oxidative stress, blood malondealdehyde levels, that stay up hours or even days later. In the spinach group, the before and after 2 weeks of spinach doesn’t seem to make much of a difference, but put the body under pressure, and then you can really see the difference. Your body is better able to deal with the stress. And, if you look at the resulting muscle damage, as measured by creatine kinase  leakage from your muscles (that\'s an enzyme that should  be in your muscles, not leaking out into your blood), you start out at about 100 and go up to 200 after the half marathon, right after, 2 hours later. But it’s the next day where you really feel it, that delayed onset muscle soreness, with CK levels reaching 600 before coming back down. Okay, that’s without spinach, though. On spinach, you get a similar immediate post-race bump, but it’s that next day where spinach really shines. You don’t get that same next-day spike, and so, for a competitive athlete, that quicker recovery may get you back training harder sooner. They attribute this to the anti- inflammatory effects of spinach. Same with black currant juice. After some hardcore weight lifting, muscle damage indicators  go up and stay up, whereas the same lifting drinking berries, and it goes up, but  comes right back down. But these were just measures of a biomarker of muscle soreness. What about actual soreness? If you look at the effects of tart cherry juice on recovery following prolonged, intermittent sprints in soccer players, you see the same kind of reduction in biomarkers of inflammation, but more importantly, less resulting muscle soreness. Here’s the soreness reported in the days afterwards in the placebo group. Only about half in the cherry group. Then, they measured maximum voluntary isometric contractions of the leg muscles, which understandably took a hit in the days after the intense workout, but not in the cherry group. They conclude that participants supplemented with a tart cherry concentrate were able to maintain greater  functional performance. But, that was testing like how high can you vertically jump. They didn’t actually see if they played soccer any better. But, this study on purple grape juice actually showed an ergogenic effect in recreational runners by promoting increased time to exhaustion, where you ramp people up on a treadmill and see how long they  can go before collapsing. After a month of drinking a grape Kool-Aid type placebo control drink, no real change in performance, but a whopping 15% improvement in the real grape group– hung on for another 12 minutes. They used juice, so they could make a matched placebo control drink, but you can buy concord grapes fresh, or tart cherries fresh, frozen, or water-packed in a can.

Based on Dr. Michael Greger's insights from the ""Boosting Heart Nerve Control"" video, dark green leafy vegetables are particularly effective. The video highlights a study that found consuming just a half serving of greens every day significantly improved neuronal heart control, which is closely linked to HRV. This improvement in heart rate variability is associated with better autonomic control over the heart, potentially reducing the risk of heart attacks and enhancing overall cardiovascular health.

Additionally, from the video ""Slow Your Beating Heart: Beans vs. Exercise,"" it is noted that beans, chickpeas, or lentils can also positively impact heart rate. Consuming these legumes daily for three months was shown to slow resting heart rate as effectively as engaging in extensive exercise, which indirectly suggests a potential improvement in HRV due to better heart rate management and reduced stress on the heart.

In summary, to relax and improve HRV, incorporating dark green leafy vegetables and legumes like beans, chickpeas, or lentils into your diet could be beneficial.

Stick your hand out, thumbs up, feel for the knobby bone  at the top of your wrist. Then, if you slide your hand down  across the front of your wrist, you’ll feel these like  strands of spaghetti— those are the tendons in your wrist. If you lightly feel between the  knobby bone and that first tendon, you should feel your pulse. Got it? Okay, now we’re going  to feel what happens to our pulse when we take a deep breath. We’re going to try it twice. Try to feel what happens to  your pulse when you inhale, and when you exhale. All right, here we go— slow inhale… slow exhale. One more time… What happened when you  breathed in and breathed out? You should have felt your pulse  speed up when you breathe in and slow down when you breathe out -- that’s called heart rate variability, and it’s a very good thing. That’s a measure of the control  our nerves have over our heart. This is the survival curve for  people after a heart attack. With good heart rate variability, 9 out of 10 people are  still alive four years later. But with bad heart rate variability,  in that time period, half drop dead from sudden cardiac death. Is there anything we can do to improve our neurological  control over our heart? A landmark article this year in the  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that there was  only one type of food that could significantly improve  our heart rate variability. Is it citrus fruits, omega-3s, or dark green leafy vegetables? Let’s look at the graph. Here’s the level at which  statistical significance is reached. Let’s see which one makes it. Eating just a half serving  of greens every day significantly improved  neuronal heart control— which may be why studies in the past have suggested a quarter  cup of greens a day could cut our risk of having  a heart attack by 67%! So control your heart— by any greens necessary.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Replay of Dr. Greger's live Q&A on Thursday, August 24.\n\n0:00 Introduction\n\n0:42 Will you update your yoga research?\n\n1:52 What can I do to limit my exposure to radiation from CT and PetScans that I have to do?\n\n4:12 My HDL is too low.

my treadmill instead of every month and answer any questions you may have for those of you unfamiliar with my work every year I read through every issue of every English language nutrition journal in the world so busy folks like you don't have to I think about the most interesting most groundbreaking most practical findings to new videos and articles that upload nearly every day on my non-profit site nutritionfacts.org everything on the website is free there are no ads no corporate sponsorship strictly non-commercial not selling anything just put it up as a public service as a labor of love as a tribute to my grandmother whose own life was saved with evidence-based nutrition all right let's get to your questions I'll just go down the list here first question is from kawar uh yoga webinar um uh I talked about the evidence um based uh presumably on a meta-analysis that covered up into 2020 what about any of the latest um uh so right now on nutritionfacts.org there is a yoga series a six part video series um I probably you know what I do is I go through Topics by alphabet um and so uh I'm almost at the end of the alphabet with with yoga um and then I start again so you'll see videos on apples and videos on you know as we go through so yoga is going to be a while but uh we'll uh when it gets its turn I'll check to see if there's anything juicy um uh there may be a lot of new science but if it basically shows what we've already seen doesn't cover any new diseases came to the same inclusions as before I'll probably skip it um same thing with apples if there's no new good apple stuff that's you know stick with what we know um uh but if there's anything really juicy um I will do more about it since uh it uh people seem to be interested all right next question uh it's from Tasha saying hello what can I do to limit my exposure to radiation oh uh from CT pet scans uh which have to monitor your condition told to take melatonin what does the sign say I do have some uh videos on what to do to cut down on the risk from ionizing radiation of course the primary one is to reduce your exposure in the first place I don't know if they can uh uh if they can stagger them out anymore that may or may not be possible um but if I remember from the video so if you just type in ionizing radiation or probably just radiation and nutritionfacts.org those videos will come up if I remember correctly I think greens um dark green leaf and vegetables presumably maybe only cruciferous I'm not sure I remember it's the only reason I remember is because uh it's one of the reasons I eat kale chips uh when I travel because when you're up in the air that high you're exposed to more cosmic rays and so you actually get quite a really I mean you don't get anywhere near a CT scan dose but uh uh you do actually get a a large relative amount dose of radiation when you uh trap when you fly um for prolonged periods and so I remember thinking oh my kale chips are perfect for this um and so if I remember correctly there's like an X Vivo study where they basically take people's blood um before and after eating greens or took uh or randomized people to eat greens or not and then exposed their um uh white blood cells so they then they took blood from them uh before and after grains and uh exposed them to uh a whopping dose radiation at the people but the blood cells and could show less DNA damage in those who had been eating grains and again I don't remember it's all grains are just cruciferous grains but that suggests that it can either boost DNA repair enzymes or maybe just to make the DNA more robust in the first place um or some kind of DNA protection mechanism but anyway um and it wasn't just greens or other food so check it out nutrition facts or pop right up sorry I don't remember but um I have to clear out space in my brain for all the new stuff coming down and just put everything up in videos and books and move on to the next thing okay next up Johnny says uh ldl2 low um I'm into ACL too low excuse me LDL 54. no you are not okay oh I'm so glad you asked that I kind of misconception um uh no you are um uh in an excellent position with an LDL at 54. um that's really what we are concerned about we used to think that uh HDL was a causal um uh uh kind of inverse respect meaning that we thought having high ACL actually protects you um from heart disease having high HDL is associated um with uh lower rates of heart disease um but the question is is it a causal risk factor or not so I actually did a video this is one of my kind of coconut oil videos if you just type in HDL it'll pop up but basically it was like um just like uh having I think I use the example I use having tennis shoes in a house is correlated with um uh you know with with exercise or having ashtrays in the house having lots of tennis shoes associated with longer life um having lots of ashtrays in the house associated with shorter live and uh but it's not that the ashtrays are hurting you it's just the ashtrays um are are pointing to a pointing to the real cause effector which in that case uh maybe tobacco use and similarly exercise is really what's helping him um and so just got some things correlated with something doesn't mean it causes something um and so that's why we have for example mendelian randomization studies where you know just from a kind of genetic random Lottery some of us are born with genes that give us lifelong elevated levels of HDL or low levels of HDL or high levels of LDL at low levels of LDL and so like regardless of what we eat regardless of whatever we just have the kind of a kind of lower levels if we were eating those same Foods or living that same lifestyle with different genes and so since that kind of genealog and it's kind of random at Birth depending on which egg cell and which sperm cell kind of got together it's kind of like a randomized controlled trial where people are like randomized have Heil deal or loyaldale at Birth kind of lifelong levels and the question is wait a second do they live longer or shorter lives so when it comes to LDL absolutely um you are just have lifelong LDL you dramatically increase risk of dying prematurely of heart disease um in fact uh um you actually have three times more benefit um having lower LDL through um through genetic Means versus Statin means or or medication means just because it's lower for longer we want to have low LDL as long as possible I'm not just starting drugs later in life though that certainly can be helpful if your levels are too high anyway so that's one of the reasons we know LDL causes um uh heart disease so okay what about people born with high HDL if it is indeed cause and effect then people should have less heart disease and turns out they don't um and so uh hos uh kind of a marker of heart health but not cause and effect so raising HCL and so no wonder the trials where they had drugs that raise ACL actually people were in one particular drug people dying more than those who didn't wear on the drug um so across the board all drug all uh drug trials to raise ACL have flopped and now we know why oh well because having pushing HDL higher doesn't actually make things better but pushing LDL lower definitely does again based on these studies there's lots of other kind of studies that we can look at but anyway so we used to worry about the low HCL um uh and like what can we do to raise it like exercise and other things um but uh it turns out that what we care about primarily LDL you can argue that APO B uh there's kind of our uh which is kind of the protein component of LDL and the LDL and IDL but um uh uh LDL is cheaper and probably better recognized although it's very that's in a common lipid panel that's what we care about is what your LDL is doing and your LDL is fantastic congratulations okay Jeff says watch my sold intake um could slightly elevated blood pressure because my stress and Mild anxiety we're taking Gaba and magnesium supplements currently taking magnesium malate um um probably the most important thing is you are not watching your salt intake enough um when people think about oh I don't need a lot of salt they're thinking about the salt that they may add in the kitchen or the dining room but in here in the U.S and it's different around the world but here in the U.S 70 75 somewhere around there of all sodium that people eat has nothing to do with the salt shaker um it has to do with processed foods um and so and when by say processed using like bread bread is leading source of sodium they had a lot of sodium to bread um and uh I think chicken is actually the number one um contributor of sodium intake between like ages 30 and 50 if I remember correctly and you're saying like wait a second like salted chicken no just regular chicken because they actually injected with salt water so it uh retains more water weight because it's sold by the pound so they make more money that way but of course all that salt and phosphate additives no good for us so uh you may think you're doing good on sodium but if you're eating processed foods you're probably not so I would make sure that you get your sodium under 1500 milligrams a day which is the American Heart Association recommendation so I would start there before worrying about other things you can do and before going to supplements I would start eating Foods um that can have been shown to lower your blood pressure I mean if you really want magnesium I want to your dark green leafy vegetables instead um and uh so hibiscus tea um can lower blood pressure a few strong cups in the morning uh better than works better than um uh leading blood pressure drug uh ground flax seeds can lower blood pressure bunch of other stuff uh so just type in blood pressure and nutrition facts that we're going to bring up those foods but again why don't we treat the cause first lower the sodium intake and then see how you're doing um and if necessary add healthy foods to the""), Document(metadata={'description': ""Live Q&A on April 26th \n\nPlease see fan's pinned comment for topics and timestamps.\n\nSubscribe to

foods and so I encourage people to stay away from any salty flavorings although look if you're eating all whole plant foods you know you can throw in some olives and still stay under that limit um but there's not much wiggle room biron Murphy asks Oh is responding to a question from maple flavor uh maple flavor would I consider doom or kitchen videos that's very kind of you to ask ah David they were very successful in terms of people seem to like them got lots of views um they're just such a pain they just take a lot of prep time um as anyone who's done cooking videos knows and so they're I have a whole list of all sorts of other cool ones I'd love to do yeah but it's just a matter of finding a time right now I'm in book mode working on the new manuscript but once that's done I'm going to do more webinars maybe I'll slip in some more cooking videos I'm glad you like them Marie Kessler asks pesticides from other sources oh you know rain onto our on a farm what do you do then what do you do is you choose organic that's yeah and reduce your pesticides I also have a DIY food and vegetable wash recipe on my facts org you can just type pesticide wash or fruit and vegetable wash and talk about ways you can reduce pesticides regardless whether you're buying conventional organic um and of course I emphasize in homeland I end in videos on the site that the the risk from pesticides is overwhelmed by the benefits of fruits and vegetables even eating lean most pesticide Laden fruits and vegetables we're talking Chilean imported grapes and bell peppers and spinach and strawberries it is still the benefits far outweigh the risk but you say what why accept any risk at all choose organic fantastic but we should never let concern about pesticides prevent us from stuffing her face full with as many fruits and vegetables as possible Rose Saxena as how much sodium oh there we go under 1500 milligrams I mentioned that before maple flavor says I think you're right about sucralose and then describes how her stools are without using it thank you for that byron Murphy asks Sicily consumes less protein you only need something amount and there is a protein almost every food oh maybe I think Byron is responding to somebody else raw sexiness is cereal a red light food ah depends what's earlier talking on most cereals are crap oh my god do you I mean they're just packed with sugar even like the so called healthy ones there's very few that actually don't have added sugar at itself but there are a few so for example Uncle Sam's I think only has two ingredients which is like rolled wheat and flax seeds oh and I think they have a berry one too acid free drug free strawberries but if you wanna but finding a cereal that actually complies with the five to one fiber rule um if you don't know what the five to one fiber rule is check out the video on that um it's almost impossible Uncle Sam's does it but very few others do um but if you if you're like oh but I really like granola or something make your own you can make your own and and not put your health in the in the hands of corporations that may not have your family's interests at heart maple flavor ass does the massive protein dump from being a plant-based source like eat protein powder without the fiber cause raised igf-1 certainly soy protein does so I believe Lydia talking about igf-1 insulin-like growth factor-1 a cancer growing and growth hormone which is your levels are boosted by animal protein consumption but also enough soy protein consumption but whether or not P protein has the amino acid profile that would raise igf-1 levels I have not looked into but there's no reason for anyone to take protein powders um you can get protein it's like saying well you get carbohydrate powder table sugar or fat powder which is basically oil right why get isolated sources of any of these when you can eat your nutrients in whole plant food all right um all right Oh light dark a snake poop question oh yeah the question is particularly cinnamon toast crunch yes that is a terrible choice but I should I should walk that back right it's always is compared to what is cinnamon toast crunch better than sausage and and eggs yes is it better than opening all not even close all right food isn't go to bed as so much as it is better or worse food is a zero-sum game everything you put in your mouth is a lost opportunity but something even healthier mouth Shushan we should always try to notch things up right Rose rose is sniffing this beautiful spring weather we're having here in DC okay oh I wish I'd get her up on the treadmill okay oh I bet I can turn the camera you want to see you want to see Rose when I had a rose hold on where's rose is that the wrong set no oh yeah Rose rose oh you can't that's not gonna work all right never mind okay never mind she'll bark at least you'll hear her yeah that didn't work okay um where are we here bjk asked when you eat raw broccoli in Mersin ace transforms glucoraphanin into Superman does any clue graph ernst ain't actin is so ba bla bla with the many benefits compared to just so for a fan um yes some stays intact but their benefits I think most of the benefits are from the that which is converted so I would just do all those tricks to convert that was a high level question I'm all for higher level questions if you don't know what I'm talking about you should go to my video second strategy something something something broccoli on nutrition facts that alright ah maple flavor as optimum protein to take for muscle growth 2.7 grams per pound of lean body weight it's actually well I don't know about that um I think she he or she is answering someone else's question point eight grams per kilogram body weight is what our what is our daily Reference intake for protein comes out to be about 50 grams a day a little more from and little less for women okay be JK is okay to eat to drink green tea right after brushing your teeth might it mess with the wind mineralization no it would actually help with remineralization because green tea is a natural source of fluoride okay um looks like Byron is responding to somebody and then GRC VGC is back asking are there natural multi vitamins worth taking there are no multivitamins worth taking as far as I'm concerned um ah unless science comes up says that they're helpful which on so far is sorely lacking although I have not done a video on it and while so maybe there's new research I will get to it my that is in I don't know if that's under V or M I've just started that my new surge through the alphabet so I just have a lot of videos coming up over the next week's on acne and berries and beans and but if you're our favorite food is zucchini you're gonna be waiting a while alright bro sexy Nass should we not eat plant-based foods high with contamination I assume they're talking about pesticide contamination like you cover lettuce grapes and mushrooms cucumbers are among the least nutrient dense foods same with lettuce but green light whole plant foods very low and clora density we should not stay away from any whole plant foods we should eat them up though they're always healthier choices so healthier choice than cucumber and lettuce would be a darker green so so particularly when lettuce is contaminated like romaine lettuce is newly Cola how about arugula on your salad or baby spinach somewhere darker is better alright okay there's a lot of responding to questions light dark zero zero says mushroom no and that's not a question Oh Rebecca asked what do I feel about immunotherapy for allergies last time I checked it's very controversial I don't know what the latest is sorry I can't help with that a lot of answers answers Oh what AIDS sleep best and deals of anxiety are we talking about stress management in my I haven't got to that section yet but most uh in terms of sleep its I do have some videos about melatonin we just found naturally a number of plant foods like strawberries and Tour cherries if I remember correctly but most of healthy sleeping is really sleep hygiene want a dark you want it cool and quiet and there's a bunch of things you if you type in sleep hygiene Google get a lot of good tips this certainly are foods that may help oh but what was the one food what's the pistachios something there's one that's just off the charts in terms of melatonin i the videos are coming up have videos on how to help with jetlag and light therapy and melatonin therapy but you do not want to take melatonin supplements that's something I learned oh and it's a really kind of scary reason why but melatonin foods and get the benefits without the risk in this one food that's just crazy off the chart I think specialist I'd have to check and you can check by checking out the video which should be coming up eventually maybe Wow ok Turtles Rodriguez si like I eat like dr. Michael Greger and my blood pressure still freakin elevated heart rate I'm 80 beats per minute it's too high can someone help me on the one my body's so stupid when everyone is thriving so in so if you are eating a hopeful pump each day and still have elevated blood pressure so my patients have been the situation typically they're actually eating - what sodium they when they say the really hopeful pump ace often they say well I don't eat meat dairy eggs or very frequently but they still may be eating packaged junk food some butch has left so you wouldn't even know lots of stuff has salt in it I'm so cut their salt down it still doesn't make it and you're really arguing whole plant foods diet center a whole plant foods and there are some foods that can draw people of pressure lower I talked about ground flaxseeds I talked about hibiscus tea and herbal tea you can take the drops blood pressure's down so just check out the chapter um how not to die""), Document(metadata={'description': ""A cup a day of beans, chickpeas, or lentils for three months may slow resting heart rate as much as 50 hours on a treadmill.\n\nCorrection: \n04:11 I say 250 hours, but meant 50 hours\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

It’s got strong advantages. Taking one’s pulse is cheap, takes little time, it’s understandable to people, and it’s something everyone can do at home to measure their progress to become an active participant in their own health management. Every ten beats per minute increase is associated with a 10 to 20% increase in the risk of death. There seems to be a continuous increase in risk with increasing heart rate, at least for values above about a beat a second. So we can just look at our watch and if our heart is beating faster than the seconds go by— even when we’re sitting quietly, then we have to do something about it, especially when we start getting up around 80 or 90. Men with no apparent heart disease evidence with a pulse of 90 may have five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death— meaning their first symptom is their last— compared to those down the safety zone. Living up around 90 increases heart disease risk at a level similar to smoking. If you ask most doctors, though, 90 is considered normal. The accepted limits of heartrate have long been set at 60 and 100 beats/min. How did they come up with that? It was adopted as a matter of convenience just based on the scale of the squares on EKG paper. A historical accident like the QWERTY keyboard that just became the norm. 60 to 100 doesn’t even represent the bell curve. These cardiologists measured the heart rate of 500 people and concluded that 45 to 95 was a better definition of normal, rounding to 50 to 90, which a survey of leading cardiologists concurred with. Now we know that normal doesn’t necessarily mean optimal, but doctors shouldn’t be telling people with heart rates in the 50’s that they\'re are too low; in fact they may be right where they should be. Certainly a heart rate higher than 80 should ring an alarm bell, but what can we do about it? Exercise is one obvious possibility. Ironically, you make the heart go faster so that that the rest of the time your heart beats slower. The public health benefits of physical exercise, especially for heart protection, are widely accepted, and among the many biological mechanisms proposed to account for this risk-reducing effect is autonomic nervous system regulation of the heart. That’s your brain’s ability to slow down the resting beat of our heart. If you put people through a 12 week aerobic conditioning program of cycling, stairmaster, and running on a treadmill, you can drop their resting heart rate down from about 69 to about 66, so three beats per minute drop. Of course you have to keep it up; stop exercising and your resting heart rate goes right back up. Exercise is just one way to drop our heartrate, though. The way to our heart may also be through our stomach. What if instead of three months of exercise, you did three months of beans? A cup a day of beans, chickpeas, or lentils. The first randomized controlled trial of beans for the treatment of diabetes. And indeed successfully improved blood sugar control dropping A1C levels from 7.4 to 6.9, but this was also the first study to ever assess the effect of bean consumption on heart rate. And indeed one of the few to determine the effect on heartrate of any dietary intervention. This is particularly important in diabetics since having a higher resting heart rate not only increases the risk of death just like everybody else, but also appears to predict greater risk of diabetic complications, such as damage to the nerves and eyes. So how did beans do? A 3.4 beat drop in heartrate— just as much as the 250 hours on a treadmill. We’re not sure why beans are as powerful as exercise in bringing down one’s resting heart rate. In addition to the potential direct beneficial effects of all the good stuff in legumes, there is also the potential displacement value of reducing some of the animal protein foods by eating so many beans instead. Regardless, we should consider eating pulses for our pulse.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'A cup a day of beans, chickpeas, or lentils for three months may slow resting heart rate as much as exercising for 250 hours on a treadmill.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

It’s got strong advantages. Taking one’s pulse is cheap, takes little time, it’s understandable to people, and it’s something everyone can do at home to measure their progress to become an active participant in their own health management. Every ten beats per minute increase is associated with a 10 to 20% increase in the risk of death. There seems to be a continuous increase in risk with increasing heart rate, at least for values above about a beat a second. So we can just look at our watch and if our heart is beating faster than the seconds go by— even when we’re sitting quietly, then we have to do something about it, especially when we start getting up around 80 or 90. Men with no apparent heart disease evidence with a pulse of 90 may have five times higher risk of sudden cardiac death— meaning their first symptom is their last— compared to those down the safety zone. Living up around 90 increases heart disease risk at a level similar to smoking. If you ask most doctors, though, 90 is considered normal. The accepted limits of heartrate have long been set at 60 and 100 beats/min. How did they come up with that? It was adopted as a matter of convenience just based on the scale of the squares on EKG paper. A historical accident like the QWERTY keyboard that just became the norm. 60 to 100 doesn’t even represent the bell curve. These cardiologists measured the heart rate of 500 people and concluded that 45 to 95 was a better definition of normal, rounding to 50 to 90, which a survey of leading cardiologists concurred with. Now we know that normal doesn’t necessarily mean optimal, but doctors shouldn’t be telling people with heart rates in the 50’s that they\'re are too low; in fact they may be right where they should be. Certainly a heart rate higher than 80 should ring an alarm bell, but what can we do about it? Exercise is one obvious possibility. Ironically, you make the heart go faster so that that the rest of the time your heart beats slower. The public health benefits of physical exercise, especially for heart protection, are widely accepted, and among the many biological mechanisms proposed to account for this risk-reducing effect is autonomic nervous system regulation of the heart. That’s your brain’s ability to slow down the resting beat of our heart. If you put people through a 12 week aerobic conditioning program of cycling, stairmaster, and running on a treadmill, you can drop their resting heart rate down from about 69 to about 66, so three beats per minute drop. Of course you have to keep it up; stop exercising and your resting heart rate goes right back up. Exercise is just one way to drop our heartrate, though. The way to our heart may also be through our stomach. What if instead of three months of exercise, you did three months of beans? A cup a day of beans, chickpeas, or lentils. The first randomized controlled trial of beans for the treatment of diabetes. And indeed successfully improved blood sugar control dropping A1C levels from 7.4 to 6.9, but this was also the first study to ever assess the effect of bean consumption on heart rate. And indeed one of the few to determine the effect on heartrate of any dietary intervention. This is particularly important in diabetics since having a higher resting heart rate not only increases the risk of death just like everybody else, but also appears to predict greater risk of diabetic complications, such as damage to the nerves and eyes. So how did beans do? A 3.4 beat drop in heartrate— just as much as the 250 hours on a treadmill. We’re not sure why beans are as powerful as exercise in bringing down one’s resting heart rate. In addition to the potential direct beneficial effects of all the good stuff in legumes, there is also the potential displacement value of reducing some of the animal protein foods by eating so many beans instead. Regardless, we should consider eating pulses for our pulse.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""The first-line treatment for hypertension is lifestyle modification, which often includes the DASH diet.

Previously, I showed how a plant-based diet may prevent high blood pressure, but what if you already have it? The American Heart Association, the American College of Cardiology, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend as the first-line treatment: lifestyle modification. If that doesn\'t work you start the patient on a thiazide diuretic, water pill, and then you keep piling on the meds until you get their blood pressure down. Commonly people will end up on three drugs, though researchers are experimenting with four at a time, and some people end up on five. Why not jump straight to the drugs? Well, they don\'t treat the underlying cause, and they can cause side-effects. Less than half of patients stick with even the first-line drugs, perhaps due to the adverse effects such as erectile dysfunction, fatigue, and muscle cramps. So what are these recommended lifestyle changes? They recommend to control one\'s weight, salt, and alcohol intake, engage in regular exercise, and adopt a DASH eating plan. The DASH diet has been described as a lactovegetarian diet, but it\'s not. It emphasizes fruits and vegetables and low-fat dairy, but just a reduction in meat. Why not vegetarian? We\'ve known for decades that food of animal origin was highly significantly associated with blood pressure. In fact, if you take vegetarians, And you give them meat, you can watch their blood pressures go right up. I\'ve talked about how there are benefits to getting blood pressure down as low as 110 over 70, but who can get that low? Populations eating plant-based diets. Like in rural China, about 110 over 70 their whole lives, with meat only eaten on special occasions. Or rural Africa, where the elderly have perfect blood pressure as opposed to hypertension. In the Western world, as the American Heart Association has pointed out, the only folks really getting down that low were the strict vegetarians, coming out about 110 over 65. So when they created the DASH diet were they just not aware of this landmark research, done by Harvard\'s Frank Sacks? No, they were aware. The Chair of the Design Committee that came up with the DASH diet was Dr. Sacks. In fact the DASH diet was explicitly designed with the #1 goal of capturing the blood pressure lowering benefits of a vegetarian diet, yet contain enough animal products to make it palatable to the general public. In fact, Sacks found that the more dairy the lactovegetarians ate, the higher their blood pressures, but they had to make the diet acceptable. Research has since shown that it\'s the added plant foods, not the changes in oil, sweets, or dairy, that appears to be the critical component, so why not eat plant-based? A recent meta-analysis showed vegetarian diets were good, but strictly plant-based diets may be better. Vegetarian diets in general confer protection against cardiovascular diseases, some cancers and death, but completely plant-based diets seem to offer additional protection for obesity, hypertension, type-2 diabetes, and heart disease mortality. Based on a study of 89,000 people, those eating meat-free diets appeared to cut their risk of high blood pressure 55%, but those eating meat-free, egg-free, and dairy-free had 75% lower risk. If, however, you\'re already eating a whole food plant-based diet, no processed foods, no table salt, and you\'re still not hitting 110 over 70, there are a few foods recently found to offer additional protection. Ground flaxseeds, a few tablespoons a day, induced one of the most potent antihypertensive effects ever achieved by a dietary intervention, 2 to 3 times more powerful than instituting an aerobic endurance exercise program. Watermelon also appears to have extraordinary effects but you\'d have to eat like 2 pounds a day. Sounds like my kind of medicine, but it\'s hard to get year-round. Red wine may help, but only if the alcohol has been taken out. Raw vegetables or cooked? And the answer is both, though raw may work better. Beans, split peas, chickpeas, and lentils may help a little. Kiwifruits though don\'t seem to work at all, even though the study was funded by a kiwifruit company.

A thousand years later, researchers discovered that a single meal containing spinach could reduce blood pressure, thanks to its nitrate content-all green leafy vegetables are packed with the stuff, which our body can use to create nitric oxide that improves the flexibility and function of our arteries, which may be why eating our greens may be one of the most powerful things we can do to reduce our chronic disease risk. Just switching from low-nitrate vegetables to high-nitrate vegetables for a week can lower blood pressure by about 4 points. And, the higher the blood pressure started out with, the greater benefit they got. 4 points might not sound like a lot, but even a 2-point drop in blood pressure could prevent more than 10,000 fatal strokes every year here in the U.S. Potassium-rich foods may also act via a similar mechanism. If we just get the minimum recommended daily intake of potassium, we might prevent 150,000 strokes every year, because potassium appears to increase the release of nitric oxide. One week of eating two bananas and a large baked potato every day significantly improved arterial function. Even a single high-potassium meal, containing the equivalent of 2 to 3 bananas worth of potassium, can improve the function of our arteries. Whereas, a high-sodium meal, which is to say a meal with the amount of salt most people eat, can impair arterial function within 30 minutes. While potassium increases nitric oxide release, sodium reduces nitric oxide release. So, the health of our arteries may be determined by our sodium to potassium ratio. Two slices of bacon worth of sodium and our arteries take a significant hit within 30 minutes, but add three bananas worth of potassium, and you can counteract the effects of the sodium. When we evolved, we were eating 10 times more potassium than sodium; now, the ratio is reversed, more sodium than potassium. These kinds of studies provide additional evidence that increases in dietary potassium should be encouraged. What does that mean? More beans, sweet potatoes, and leafy greens, which are like a double whammy, high in potassium and nitrates. This recommendation to eat spinach from the 900s is pretty impressive, though they also recommended bloodletting and abstaining from sex; so, we should probably take ancient wisdom with a grain of salt, but our meals should be added-salt free.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Every month I go live from my treadmill to answer your questions here on YouTube and on Facebook.

marathon athletes live longer huh it's a fantastic question I do not know the answer to that obba find out let me know that's neat ah Marjorie says hello hello Dibya ass how do I convince loved ones that dairies and healthy when doctors recommend it as a part of a healthy diet um well I mean if you're willing to you can ask you doctor uh you know to provide you evidence that there aren't healthier way that it's really the healthiest way to get those nutrients I'm so I mean certainly there's calcium in dairy just like there's protein in pork and iron and beef but you know food is a package deal right as much as burg King says have it your way you can't be like yeah I gotta get a burger hold the statue in fact cholesterol no it all comes together um so by getting your calcium from low ox late dark green leafy vegetables for example then the baggage you get is not baggage is the bonus right you get the fiber in the folate and all this other wonderful things found the Greens missing from the dairy you know every time so so basically since soon as a package deal we should get our nutrients in the package that's healthiest so now you can get boxes of Froot Loops says now with calcium in it I mean that's dude that's you know I mean that there's this the food industry loves this nutrient centrism the sense that you know we just need the individual nutrients it's all about nutrients rather than food they love that cuz anything take absolute junk multicolored marshmallows spray it with some multivitamins and then claim it's healthy when we're not dying from deficiency diseases like very very employer and of course your corns curve a we're dying from these excess diseases like excess sugar salt saturated fat cholesterol and that's of course what they're trying to sell you after sprinkling some vitamins on it boy did I get off-topic what was the question Oh dairy huh so I'm yes you can get calcium and dairy but there are healthier sources of calcium I encourage you do that senior counsel we're not the butterfat without the cholesterol um and with all these other wonderful added bonus ingredients so that's what I would recommend right so food isn't my you know bad nor good but better or worse and there's certainly better sources then Dairy Milk is for babies all right Cleveland Clinic states that eggs are healthy to consume and again it's well compared to what I'm compared to breakfast sausage absolutely I agree whoa compared to Oh will not even colos right and so look food is a lost art but every time food has an opportunity cost everything we only have about what two thousand calories in the calorie bank every day so every time we put something in our mouths it's a lost opportunity to put something even healthier in our mouth um and so it's lots healthier things to put in our mouth then eggs sharra asks what'd I ever do a serious oh and Paulo cystic ovaries yes I've got videos on PCOS check it out ty PCOS and didn't do

not just his nose who his name is Cyrus his name is Cyrus what's his last name Cyrus Khambatta so if you go to mango man nutrition Icom uh you can you can learn about his stuff okay um where are we okay um Charlie L what are the best foods for weight loss that's that's a great question I just started my new book how not to diet managed doing March will be out December 2019 um and so I'm working on that all right as we speak but even before I'm doing all the new research for the book um presumably things that are high in fiber water high nutrient density low and caloric density be a good place to start and so that's one of the reasons why whole food plant-based diets appear to be so useful in Oran people to eat all they want but lose weight just because plant foods tend to be so chloric ly dilute that you can eat till you're full and without overdoing calories alright Simon Says thoughts on anything in particular JAF says due to dried fruits raised triglyceride dried fruits in the context of excess calories can just as anything can raise triglycerides but just dried foods on their own should not affect your triglyceride levels yeah but same thing with like soda you got a sip a soda it's not gonna raise triglycerides either but you have a liter of soda in your triglycerides will shoot out low sexina a thank you for oh thanks for answering a question is great um oh and her real name is roshni and I'm 16 years old and admirers and oh and says that veganism cured her eczema - wonderful I'm so glad that your finger show better hacks I'm 21 says how have I been good thank you thank you so much Oh wonderful eight months eating healthy happier than ever that's what I like to hear wonderful um our gears raw vegan recovery asks what's the best mouthwash green tea with some Amla added that's what I that's right used for a mouthwash um and so if you type in mouthwash you all those videos will pop up the most important thing you stay away from antibiotic Michael um mouthwash is because you have these bacteria that live on your tongue that take the that label to use that nitrates that are pumped out in your salivary glands to give you all sorts of wonderful benefits from the nitrate rich in vegetables you eat but you below it you ruin all those wonderful nitrates from arugula or beetroot if you have killed off those good bacteria on your tongue so no antimicrobial mouthwash and the green tea and Amla which is dried Indian gooseberry powder you can just make your own Amma shake bottle um will help reduce your cavity risk I think that's why um that I made that concoction but you have checked the video to check it out all right um ooh so Rebecca says can a Crohn's patient eat bread so this is probably a a reference to video series I did about how Crohn's patients may want to reduce their intake of baker's yeast brewers yeast and nutritional yeast and so so yeah so thinking about baker's yeast um I so you one would have to either I guess an unleavened bread quick breads a matzah in order to cut down one's intake of yeast do we have so ya know so we um there's I know you gotta watch the series of videos I was really quite compelled so there's both hit ready hit ready - uh Pratibha one autoimmune disease and Crohn's disease would seem to improve I'm cutting down on yeast so now I used it as a way to curse people not to add go out of the way to add I'm used to the diet like I wouldn't be adding nutritional yeast to foods but yeah one could take that logical step to try to stay away from yeast all together to see if that improves your condition I mean so that would include most of yeast raised breads primo primo Zee oh I'm sorry I pronounce your name are there any news mmm is there any news about psoriasis and diet um yeah I think I read video about psoriasis I've just typed in psoriasis nutrition backdoor a little pop up um I think it was in relation oh it's escaping me now oh no check it out I think I do if I don't let me know in a month B might be yeah how do you feel coming up and I give you a sense of when that video will be out okay kealan ass is just a myth that cows milking leeches calcium from the bones yeah it's a mess cow's milk does not least calcium from the bones um even if it did it has so much calcium in it that overall calcium balance would be maintained yeah don't yeah calcium does not leach calcium from the bones cow's milk does not least calcium from the bones um and so I have a video with something about the titleist animal protein bones calcium something like that it'll go through the science sawing that that was a that was not that was a long-term misconception among this the general nutrition community that high protein intakes plead excess calcium loss and that's because hypertension intakes increased absorption of calcium pronounced so all this calcium that you're peeing out after eating a steak isn't coming from bones as I should coming from your diet predominantly and so that until we radioactively-labeled calcium we have no idea where the Caliph's come from and so no wonder we had this misconception but we've known better for many many years Jodie as to please do be about like to shock in oral elegy symptoms related to hay fever I think the only anaphylaxis videos I have about are the of those crazy Lone Star tick videos who gives people an allergy to red meat you get bitten by a tick and all of a sudden making it allergic reactions to eating meat I think of so many ones I have if anything pops up I will let you know that I think is is useful for a general audience skeezy schism willie asks says that that they've been eating a plant-based but still suffer from a fast resting heart rate and bad insomnia what would you do um so both are high

One of the things you can try to do prevent them is to identify the triggers and avoid them. Common triggers for migraines include stress, smoke, hunger, sleep issues, certain trigger foods like chocolate, cheese, and alcohol, your menstrual cycle, or certain weather patterns. In terms of dietary treatments, the Father of Modern Medicine, William Osler, suggested  trying a strict vegetable diet. After all, the nerve inflammation associated with migraines may be reduced by a strictly plant-based diet, as many plant foods are high in anti-inflammatory compounds and antioxidants, and likewise, meat products may have pro-inflammatory properties, but it wasn\'t put to the test for another 117 years. Among those given a placebo supplement, half said they got better, half said they didn\'t. But when put on a strictly plant-based diet they did much better, experiencing a significant drop in the severity of their pain. Now it\'s possible that the pain reducing effects of the plant-based diet may have at least been in part, due to the weight reduction; they lost about 9 more pounds  in their vegan month. Even just lowering the fat content of the diet may help. Those placed on a month of consuming less than 30 grams of fat a day, like less than two tablespoons of oil all day, experienced highly significant decreases in headache frequency, intensity, duration, and the need to take medications, a six- fold decrease in frequency and intensity. From three migraine attacks every two weeks, down to just one a month. And by low fat they didn\'t mean SnackWell\'s; they meant more fruits, vegetables, beans. Before the food industry co-opted and corrupted the term, eating low fat meant like eating an apple, not Apple Jacks. Now this was a really low-fat diet, like 10% fat for someone eating 2500 calories a day. What about just less than 20% fat, compared to a more normal, but still relatively lower fat diet than average? Same significant drops in headache frequency and severity, including a 5-fold drop in attacks of severe pain. Since the intervention involved at least halving of saturated fat intake, mostly found in meat, dairy, and junk, the researchers concluded that a reduction of saturated fat intake may help control migraine attacks, but it\'s not necessarily something that they\'re getting less of. There are compounds present in live green real veggies that might bind to a migraine-triggering peptide known as CGRP. Drug companies have been trying to come up with something that binds to it, but the drugs have failed to be effective, and are also toxic, a problem you don\'t see with cabbage. Green vegetables also have magnesium, found throughout the food supply but mostly concentrated in green leafy vegetables, beans, nuts, seeds, and whole grains. It\'s actually the central atom to chlorophyll, so you can see how much magnesium foods have in the produce aisle by the intensity of their green color. Magnesium supplements do not appear to decrease migraine severity, but may reduce the number of attacks you get in the first place. You can ask your doctor about starting 600 mg of magnesium dicitrate every day, but note, magnesium supplements can cause adverse effects such as diarrhea, so I recommend getting it in the way nature intended. Any foods that may particularly help? I\'ve talked about ground ginger. Combining caffeine with over-the-counter pain killers like Tylenol, aspirin and ibuprofen may boost their efficacy, about 130 milligrams for tension-type headaches and 100 mg for migraines, about what you might expect to get in three cups of tea, though I believe it\'s just a coincidence that the principle investigator was named Lipton. Note you can overdo it. If you take kids and teens who have headaches, drinking one and a half liters of cola a day, and cut the cola, you can cure 90% of them, though this may be a Coca-Cola effect rather than a caffeine effect. And finally, one plant food that may not be the best idea is this innocent-looking fellow, The Carolina Reaper, the hottest chili pepper in the world. So mind-numbingly hot it can clamp off the arteries in your brain and you can end up with a so-called thunderclap headache, like this 34-year old man. Why am I not surprised it was a man?')]","Dark green leafy vegetables are the type of food found to significantly improve heart rate variability (HRV), which is a measure of the control our nerves have over our heart.

Michael Greger live from my treadmill here to answer any and all questions you may have I did a facebook live earlier today and doing YouTube now will do this every month for those who come from others my work every year I read through every issue of every English language nutrition journal in the world some busy folks like you don't have to I think follow most interesting most groundbreaking most practical findings into new videos novels upload everyday to my website nutritionfacts.org everything on the website is free there are no ads no commercial uh no corporate sponsorship strictly non-commercial not selling anything just put it up as a public service as a labor of love as a tribute to my grandmother who is the reason that I went into medicine and practice lifestyle medicine to this day let me start at the top and I will go through the questions and hopefully get to yours Paulo a so many health concerns associated with drinking water from plastic bottles I guess there are if you look at there are both microbiological concerns as well as chemical concerns so for example from polycarbonate plastic if you search on nutrition of Exxon org for the word for the letters BPA my you will see my videos about some of these plastics chemicals also on phthalates start spelled with a P P th ala tes my check out those or just type in plastics or plastic into nutrition facts that are a little search bar all my videos will come up um and you can enjoy lance ass how do I prevent water intoxication if I don't salt my foods um if um so hyponatremia is you can actually wash out the electrolytes in your system if you um exercise intensely sweat a lot and or just drinking pure water the concern was that wait a second don't have to add salt to my food as if for millions of years of evolution we had salt shakers sitting there um no need to add salt food um but we should but if you are excessively exercising you need to replete your electrolytes that's the whole kind of gatorade thing you can do it a lot healthier than just drinking sugar water by eating actual food like fruit um and so we should get all our sodium from natural sources not from salsa come not from processed foods you do not have to take a bag of potato chips on your bike rides ah seabird asks I am requesting an option to see Spanish subtitles absolutely in fact we have Spanish subtitles on hundreds of videos people don't realize that if you do a search for videos on nutrition of X or um there's language options you can say I just want to see the ones with Polish subtitles or Russian subtitles or you know the Italian subtitles amen Spanish is actually our most common one we've got hundreds of videos already translated we have a whole team of translation volunteers you actually can be one of those if you'd like to help out we're actually going to convert the entire site into Spanish so not just the subtitles for all the videos but like all the wording on the site so it would be like a little flag you know you go to some websites and it's like you can choose your language um well it's going to be same thing nutrition facts outdoor where you can see in English when you see the entire site in Spanish um and then we're going to move to other languages to broaden the number of people that can have access to this life-changing life-saving information but right now you can access those Spanish subtitles by just doing a search on nutrition facts at work and then clicking the spanish-language buttons all right Laura asked coumadin I've been diagnosed ah with a thrombus a clot warfare every day to maintain a 9r they're vegetarians does guarantee bristled without anticoagulants absolutely not you need anti if you have excessively clotting blood for whatever reason or if you have a heart valve or any kind of internal hardware that could cause your blood to clot although there is there are there's basically what's called salicylic acid which is kind of the active ingredient in aspirin found in plant foods not just in willow bark or as originally harvested from UM and so people eating plant-based diets particularly the spicy plant-based that's just a lot of salicylates in spices like cumin ma you will have blood levels of aspirin on which rival that of people actually taking a baby aspirin a small dose aspirin pill every day even though you're not on aspirin you have the same aspirin doses of your body that may actually been be beneficial in terms of reducing not only heart disease risk a stroke risk certain types of stroke risk as well as cancer risk and I've got a bunch of videos coming up on aspirin and cancer but that's not your blood would not be thin enough to prevent clots if you have some excessive clotting disorder and so if your physician wants you on coumadin then you need to to remain on coumadin as long and just make sure that you they titrate the greens consumption you dark green leafy vegetable consumption the mountain community does basically cumin is a vitamin k poison and so on if you eat a lot of vitamin K you need up your dose to keep them in line alright okay Lance okay um Lance is just making some comments that's good okay I'm gonna keep going down um um I don't know how to pronounce a Jo a with a little thing on it Oh I'm sorry I said he has an exam with 289 people on grams per milliliter of b12 as at a healthy level ma you assuming those the units I'm familiar with um yes that would be fine but you still would want to take the question is should continue to take vitamin b12 of course you should a 2500 microns once a week of cyanic of elements probably all you or anyone should need I mean you say well wait a second more fine levels are fine well they won't be fine for long if you don't get a regular reliable source of vitamin b12 um Sarah read an article from a nutrigenomics company saying that your genes determine whether or not animal or plant base to make 3s are good for you all mega 3s are originally plant-based and are then created by animals such as yourselves when you eat them there may be polymorphisms but which means kind of gene variations in mod Delta 60 saturates enzymes the elongation enzymes but and so one may want to take a preformed long-chain omega-3 fatty acid supplement I've got a bunch of videos new videos about that so check it out a vitamin Lindsay says what do I think about intermittent fasting I've got a bunch of videos on intermittent fasting coming up I keep saying that but I do and it's actually a really complex topic um and but I will be talking about all the variations of intermittent fast and water-only fasting the timing duration meals all sorts of good stuff it's all coming out um it's not that I'm trying to keep anything from you I just haven't read all the science yet there's tremendous load hundreds of new articles um and so I want to make sure I have a sense of where they're going just doing kind of a light reading but I wanted to a deep dive before I before I synthesize all the available science alright Michael good name s if you take a DHA EPA supplement how much ala should get every day as it's still important to keep in to make a six to make a three ratio 4 to 1 um so um if you're already getting prima so the reason one wants to keep their ratio relatively low makes 16 mega threes is to kind of facilitate your body's elongation stretching omega-3s found in flax seeds and walnuts not into the long-chain versions um but also G still need to do that if you're taking um you know and and you need to get a source of of of ala like flex seeds or walnuts or hemp nuts or chia seeds if you're already taking that and my answer is yes to both but not for the reason one might think so I mean what's the recommendation to about make six ratio it stay away from junky vegetables like Cornell safflower oil sunflower oil concealed oil so you'd still want to do that regardless for all sorts of reasons and why so do you not have to take flax seeds now if you're getting a preformed source of of DHA will make you three something only reason we eat a super healthy foods like black seeds and walnuts they have other health problem in compounds for example flax seeds have these anti-cancer lignin compounds which you know you would be missing out on so it's still stick with my daily doesn't recommend actually get a tablespoon of ground flax seeds every day for the other health benefits priscila talked about BPA at the beginning ah ma soeur know are there plant foods that reverse postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and small fiber neuropathy um I do not know of any um but if you do a PubMed search so if you go PubMed gov govt um that's the database National Library of Medicine or just medical library in the world and you type in whatever grow that you're interested in and the word diet or foods or such and Stace come up um I'd be have it look at them send them my way I will dig them up and if there's something interesting useful for others I will make a video about it and share with others alright Steve what foods would I recommend for a toddler to have on a daily basis Oh like a daily dozen toddler version that's a good idea I should come up with that um until I do though I would encourage you to check out wonderful sources like anything Brenda Davis is written or read mangles has written they both done wonderful books and chapters on feeding healthy diets to infants and small children um Cristina named assessing research on diet macular degeneration very certain there is I just haven't looked at it yet I haven't got to my latest I folder um studies I could actually look at it now but it would take some time but if there is I realize that's an issue that a lot of people deal with and we'll definitely do any videos on any new exciting developments in that area David asks what foods increased stamina and energy I need more than a caffeine jolt um well um the question is I mean you should

air breathed air so you shouldn't breathe air what I mean yeah but normal you know non villainous people also breathe air like it doesn't make a lot of sense anyway I'm not saying sugars good for you I think we should cut out all that in the sugars from the dead okay maple flava is back I'm saying do I use a wire to still have no Martin distiller seems to me to I waste of energy resilient H tasks we're Cleef ight information on a healthy level of fitness at different ages what we should be able to do oh that's interesting like how many pushups should be able to do at age 70 or whatever um I've

thing is a healthy diet period and exercise actually can improve load if we're talking about depression means I'm trying to think if I have stuff on saffron let me see saffron lavender and you just got a type of mental illness whatever particular mental illness you're interested in and nutrition facts are to pull up all the foods now I encourage you to just I mean you just make things with you know make Paia with your saffron I'm sure you could take it in capsules as a supplement if you really wanted to um Rebecca asked can it should a Crohn's a patient take probiotics and a multivitamin Crohn's patients should eat healthfully I have not reviewed the probiotics Crohn's Liz you're in a while but I think of something really phenomenal that popped up I would have heard about it and I mean dependent I mean if you're a Crohn's patient that has much of your intestine removed and you might run into Vitamin kind of absorption issues but that be something you talk to you or physician about in terms of what parts your intestine and intestinal tract have been removed and then talk about what particular nutrient deficiencies you might run into certainly see a lot of problem with that with people getting these kind of gastric bypass operations running into serious nutrient deficiencies but if you have your entire gut then you should be able to get all your nutrients from the produce aisle with the exception of vitamin b12 and vitamin T all right Jesse Byrne tick sorry if I'm mispronouncing everybody's names ah says I always put my questions on YouTube every month in advance and they never show up well it just did and so if this was a question instead of saying them I would answer it anyway Leanne a yes I came across something called alkaloid build-up um and it being important to rotate your greens that sounds like that just sounds like crazy talk to me it sounds like there's someone on the internet trying to get clicks by confusing people maple flavor so should I trust the added vitamins b12 etc in my daily great value bran flakes oh can you rely on them as it's being really there like if it says that it must be twelve um should you trust your brand Flake manufacturer well ideally we probably should be eating bran flakes I mean presumably I mean most cold cereals with very few exceptions are pretty bad for you they have a lot of it sugar at its salt there's a few exceptions like Uncle Sam cereal basically has like I think two ingredients right rolled whole wheat berries and like flax seeds but but anything processed like that it's just not a very healthy food but in terms of does it actually have the vitamins that it that it says probably although vitamin b12 was so critically important for people eating plant-based diets I wouldn't necessarily rely on rely on their word for it um Adam a wants to play asks any videos about the benefits of being in nature oh cool Japanese first bathing you know I've never heard about that I'm even know how I ran across it probably because I put in maybe if I put in like green leafy vegetables or something and they caught the word green pubmed and anyway there's this very interesting body of literature about the purported health benefits of being in nature now of course you can imagine all the co-founders who's in nature people actually have to kind of walk into nature so this exercise then there's like fresh air there's sunshine so is being in nature actually good for you beyond just all those other things like if you walked on a treadmill and had fresh air and sunshine would it be the same as being surrounded by forests so they do these studies where they're I put people in front of a TV screen and they show you before oh you lots of green but you're actually not in a forest maybe there's some like you know you know pine needle compounds in the air that are beneficial anyway you can imagine how difficult those kind of studies are but there have been a couple well-designed studies I'm actually gonna do a series of videos on that very topic stay to Rebecca and not Vieira asks when you have your appendix taken out should you change your diet at all um well you should vastly improve your diet as appendicitis is is kind of a consequence of eating a measurable Western low fiber diet so something like appendicitis is rare among population centers their diets are not whole plant food so that's probably just you should take that as a sign that you haven't mean enough flavor containing foods predominately beans and old grains and so you should bump it up a notch TJ

Michael Greger coming to you live from my treadmill like I do every month to answer any questions you may have this year I'm excited to answer your question in person in book signing lines in Q&A is 200 cities lined up although I've only got like 190 to go or something been on the road for a couple of weeks in Southern California in Arizona but hopefully we'll be in your town soon including countries like Poland and Denmark and Iceland for the first time ever I'm really excited in Denmark is crazy they had to open a whole bed like an 800 person theater they had to do a second thing because they sold out so quickly they're doing a whole second showing I guess I'm gonna do two back-to-back that is just so coolest place I've ever even been so I just I think speaks to the tremendous surge in interest in healthy eating so that's super exciting so that's the best part is seeing everybody of course all the travel and bad food and bad sleep is not the best part but I'll be done 10 months and off to write the next book how not to age anyway for those who are unfamiliar to every year I redo every issue of every English ladies nutrition journal the world so busy folks like you don't have to I think upon combined all the most interesting most groundbreaking most practical families and the new videos and articles upload every day nearly every day to my number I would say nutritionfacts.org everything on the website is what free there are no ads no corporate sponsorship strictly non-commercial not saw anything just put it up as a public service as a labor of love as a tribute to my grandmother new videos an article said free day nearly every day and latest an evidence-based nutrition what a concept alright let's start with your questions what's so nice about Facebook log as opposed to YouTube no YouTube I supposed to Facebook live is the questions don't move like you're putting your questions down and I just go in order I don't have to skip it and cuz it scroll up too quickly but um so let's do it number one Steve Parker why eliminate nutritional yeast I'm sorry if you've got that impression so on Facebook someone with hid retinitis support Eva says what should I cut out of my diet I said nutrition 'is there are two groups of individuals that should not eat nutritional yeast well three I guess one if you have an allergy which I've never heard of but on to is if you have had United subroutine v''e which is autoimmune condition as well as Crohn's disease why I've got videos on that just type in nutritionist and check it all out but for everybody else just say is perfectly fine and I had some for breakfast actually all right Carl Carl yeah Carl Cramer says any advice for loose skin and post big weight loss first of all congratulations on the big weight loss you will off so much weight you have loose skin that is a phenomenal feat keep up the good work but unfortunately the only thing new there are only surgical interventions in terms of cosmetic surgery to get rid of the excess flaps of skin and for everybody else not gain that much weight in the first place my synergy dance Dan CO or synergy dance acts how are the majority of longest-living people in blue zones doing so well despite eating meat fish dairy occasionally you just answered your own question because they only eat meat fish dairy occasionally so for example the Okinawan Japanese the second longest living population in the world of course this is when they weren't eating KFC like they are now they actually have some of the worst public health statistics now but in the 50s when they're reading how their more traditional diets they had like a 97% plant-based diet and so and really have that kind of a sweet potato vegetable based diet um the only people live longer than them only formerly study population is the seven day Adventists vegetarians Loma Linda California I just spoken love Linda that was a lot of fun and and they don't eat any meat at all and they're the only blue zone that actually like continues to be a blue zone right now these other these are historical examples they now westernized their diet so but the blue zone that is doing the best and continues to thrive is the one that doesn't eat any meat at all and living about a decade longer and general population Richard Strauss says what's the optimal dose is your vitamin E per day well dosage implies you're taking vitamin supplement want to do actually there's a study suggesting that those taking vitamin E supplements actually cut their lives short but you do need vitamin E but you should get it from natural sources like that's in seeds um why do Oh possible possibly right says why do we avoid mr. Solis I didn't say that I only said if you have Crohn's disease and or hidradenitis suppurativa everybody else feel free to eat your nutrition yeast in fact it's a way to get your vitamin b12 if it's fortified with b12 oh speaking of b12 ApS is duckweed a safe plant source for b12 and the answer is not until it's proven to be right I mean that's critically important all right vitamin b12 so the company that makes it or that packaged it that sells it purports on to show active b12 that is improvement until people with b12 deficiency are a given duckweed is a sole source and their b12 level recovers right there home assistant comes down if they're fully replete or they're methylmalonic acid level drops it's the only way right um so there's a lot of tests for b12 that don't necessarily show active b12 there are b12 analogs cause your body can't use fools our body actually they're like connect as anti b12 so you just do not want to mess around you can end up paralyzed demented or dead from a b12 deficiency so until it's proven to be a reliable source where they actually do a clinical study you could it's easy to find vegans low in b12 right because so many vegans are too stupid to not to to not supplement they are stupid for not supplementing and um so you put pretend of them twenty of them and give them some duckweed and see what happens and until then it's not a reliable source of b12 until it's proven to be a reliable source of b12 because it's not something you want to mess around with all right critically important all right and look even if they claimed that there's a bacteria that kind of lives in the duckweed that produce would be 12 let's say they do the study and they show that a batch of duckweed improves their their veto status okay that's great so you can you say that that batch of duckweed improves to be 12 it doesn't mean all duckweed or all the duckweed they even sell has active b12 maybe it has different bacteria that aren't making b12 at the moment so unless they can show reliably that whatever species of duckweed they have just always makes b12 that's always usable by people if that's not the case then you need to stick with supplements a vitamin b12 or vitamin b12 fortified foods okay Emily Paige Peron or posh a Peron says hi what you take on gluten flour homemade note well no salt say 1000 obviously so not a whole food but it's a green yellow or green light food um so it's a yellow light food it's the process plant food so it's a platform from which something bad good has been taken away or something bad has been added and here's this case nothing bad has been added but there has been something good taken away right you you know how to make seitan you wash away the fiber wash away some nutrition but but in terms of meat substitutes certainly better then you know everything else in the market right which has added sodium often added saturated fat of course what would be even better meets us to real whole food like legumes whole grains mushrooms these kind of things okay anyway tattooed woman asked please talk about nano volley pig in assists and how hard it is for the Oh for the body it turned carbohydrate into fat so tattooed women did not mean men denovo leap in Genesis she meant that de novo epigenesis so your body so it's true that if you over feed people calories it's easier to make people gain weight giving people fat calories in carbohydrate calories in fact you can make 100,000 College disappear by effective feeding people trying to over feed people carbohydrates opposed to fat I talked about this study but in long Vermont prisoners where they tried this experimental weight gain say they tried to get people to gain weight took one hundred thousand more calories on a mixed diet then then all fat died but but the problem it so but if you like you drink all ones if you drink a couple liters of soda a day even though you won't make a lot of fat you know where that fat is made that fat is made in your liver increases liver fat which is can dull the sensitivity to insulin in your liver and set you up for all sorts of badness so so yeah do not overeat my added sugars so yeah okay so even if it doesn't you're like oh it just puts a few grams of fat on your body huh yeah because where it is liver fat that's a bad thing increase your risk of fat liver disease again bad thing okay the chosen comment asks someone working in hospitals working for on for office it possible is it difficult to it is difficult to intermittent task I'm not eating the middle of night any recommendations I don't eat the middle of the night I mean that's there's not much you can do I mean there's all sorts of clonal biological badness that comes along with night shifts I'm like the light in the middle of the night that's not good but you can't do much about that but you can do something about eating so you don't eat it you still don't either die on you eat before you go to before you go to bed and in the morning or before you go to - - to work and in terms of well I'm gonna get so hungry going on that without food well you need to you know eat your thylakoids you

They’re just talking about associations, meaning berry eaters and nut eaters tend to have better brain function as they age after trying to control for a bunch of other lifestyle factors, but you don’t know if it’s cause and effect... until you put it to the test. Thankfully, we now have a growing number of interventional studies that have done just that. Randomized controlled trials where people eat berries or nuts and you can prove it— actually show improvements in cognitive performance, raising the berry nutty idea that we may be able to forestall or reverse the effects of neurodegeneration in aging with food. For example, this study on the effects of walnut consumption on cognitive performance. College students split up into groups doing two months of walnuts followed by two months of placebo or vice versa and then they switch. How do you make a placebo nut? They baked it in. They gave people banana bread with or without nuts; same ingredients, just one with walnuts, and those on the nuts showed a significant improvement in “inference capacity,” the ability to accurately draw conclusions from a set of facts, in other words, critical thinking. And so, on a practical level, maybe students or young professionals in fields that involve a great deal of critical thinking or decision-making could possibly benefit and gain a slight advantage through regular consumption of walnuts. Or this berry study, where they randomized folks to some crazy berry smoothie with blueberries, black currants, elderberries, lingonberries, strawberries, and…  a tomato. And not only did their bad cholesterol drop about 10 points, they performed better on short-term memory tests; so, good for the heart, good for the brain. And not just better on like pencil-and-paper tests, but real-world applications. Give people concord grape juice versus some fake grape Kool-Aid-type placebo, and you get improved performance on everyday tasks—like quicker response times in driving tests. Why not just give people concord grapes instead of juice? Well, then, it’s harder to create a placebo and, of course, the study was paid for by Welch’s. OK, fruit and nuts, what about vegetables? Consumers of cruciferous vegetables, like cabbage, cauliflower, kale, collards, broccoli and Brussels sprouts, have been found to perform better in several cognitive tests than non-users. In terms of cognitive decline with aging, women consuming the most green leafies did better, effectively slowing brain aging a year or two, and not just cruciferous, but other dark green leafies like spinach; so, maybe it’s the nitrates. As we age, our cerebral blood flow drops, the amount of blood flowing through our brain, which may be due to an age-related decrease in the production of nitric oxide, the open sesame molecule that dilates our blood vessels and is boosted by the consumption of nitrate-rich vegetables. This reduction in blood flow to the brain may be a major risk factor for the impairment of cognitive function and development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia. We know nitrate-rich vegetables like leafy greens and beets can improve physiological performance, like beet juice does for athletes, but what about cognitive performance? We’ll find out…next.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'What are the effects of spinach and berries on oxidative stress, inflammation, and muscle soreness in athletes?\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

What about the consumption of fruit and vegetables and risk of frailty in the elderly? Higher fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with lower frailty as well, in a dose-response manner, meaning more fruit less frailty, and more vegetables too, but these were all observational studies, which can’t alone prove cause-and-effect. What happens when you  put foods to the test? Well, no positive influence ingesting chia seed oil on human running performance, but there was an effect found for spinach supplementation on exercise-induced oxidation stress. And by spinach supplementation, they meant they just gave some guys some fresh raw spinach leaves, one gram per kilo, so like a quarter of a bunch a day for two weeks and then they had them  run a half marathon. And, they found that “chronic daily oral supplementation of spinach,” uh meaning like eating a salad, has alleviating effects on known markers of oxidative stress and muscle damage, Here’s what happens when you run a half marathon without spinach: a big spike in oxidative stress, blood malondealdehyde levels, that stay up hours or even days later. In the spinach group, the before and after 2 weeks of spinach doesn’t seem to make much of a difference, but put the body under pressure, and then you can really see the difference. Your body is better able to deal with the stress. And, if you look at the resulting muscle damage, as measured by creatine kinase  leakage from your muscles (that\'s an enzyme that should  be in your muscles, not leaking out into your blood), you start out at about 100 and go up to 200 after the half marathon, right after, 2 hours later. But it’s the next day where you really feel it, that delayed onset muscle soreness, with CK levels reaching 600 before coming back down. Okay, that’s without spinach, though. On spinach, you get a similar immediate post-race bump, but it’s that next day where spinach really shines. You don’t get that same next-day spike, and so, for a competitive athlete, that quicker recovery may get you back training harder sooner. They attribute this to the anti- inflammatory effects of spinach. Same with black currant juice. After some hardcore weight lifting, muscle damage indicators  go up and stay up, whereas the same lifting drinking berries, and it goes up, but  comes right back down. But these were just measures of a biomarker of muscle soreness. What about actual soreness? If you look at the effects of tart cherry juice on recovery following prolonged, intermittent sprints in soccer players, you see the same kind of reduction in biomarkers of inflammation, but more importantly, less resulting muscle soreness. Here’s the soreness reported in the days afterwards in the placebo group. Only about half in the cherry group. Then, they measured maximum voluntary isometric contractions of the leg muscles, which understandably took a hit in the days after the intense workout, but not in the cherry group. They conclude that participants supplemented with a tart cherry concentrate were able to maintain greater  functional performance. But, that was testing like how high can you vertically jump. They didn’t actually see if they played soccer any better. But, this study on purple grape juice actually showed an ergogenic effect in recreational runners by promoting increased time to exhaustion, where you ramp people up on a treadmill and see how long they  can go before collapsing. After a month of drinking a grape Kool-Aid type placebo control drink, no real change in performance, but a whopping 15% improvement in the real grape group– hung on for another 12 minutes. They used juice, so they could make a matched placebo control drink, but you can buy concord grapes fresh, or tart cherries fresh, frozen, or water-packed in a can. I mix them with oatmeal, cocoa, and mint leaves for a chocolate-covered- cherry type sensation. You may want to try that for a few days before participating in your next big sporting event.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'The effects of spinach and berries on oxidative stress, inflammation, and muscle soreness in athletes.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

And, if you look at the resulting muscle damage, as measured by creatine kinase  leakage from your muscles (that\'s an enzyme that should  be in your muscles, not leaking out into your blood), you start out at about 100 and go up to 200 after the half marathon, right after, 2 hours later. But it’s the next day where you really feel it, that delayed onset muscle soreness, with CK levels reaching 600 before coming back down. Okay, that’s without spinach, though. On spinach, you get a similar immediate post-race bump, but it’s that next day where spinach really shines. You don’t get that same next-day spike, and so, for a competitive athlete, that quicker recovery may get you back training harder sooner. They attribute this to the anti- inflammatory effects of spinach. Same with black currant juice. After some hardcore weight lifting, muscle damage indicators  go up and stay up, whereas the same lifting drinking berries, and it goes up, but  comes right back down. But these were just measures of a biomarker of muscle soreness. What about actual soreness? If you look at the effects of tart cherry juice on recovery following prolonged, intermittent sprints in soccer players, you see the same kind of reduction in biomarkers of inflammation, but more importantly, less resulting muscle soreness. Here’s the soreness reported in the days afterwards in the placebo group. Only about half in the cherry group. Then, they measured maximum voluntary isometric contractions of the leg muscles, which understandably took a hit in the days after the intense workout, but not in the cherry group. They conclude that participants supplemented with a tart cherry concentrate were able to maintain greater  functional performance. But, that was testing like how high can you vertically jump. They didn’t actually see if they played soccer any better. But, this study on purple grape juice actually showed an ergogenic effect in recreational runners by promoting increased time to exhaustion, where you ramp people up on a treadmill and see how long they  can go before collapsing. After a month of drinking a grape Kool-Aid type placebo control drink, no real change in performance, but a whopping 15% improvement in the real grape group– hung on for another 12 minutes. They used juice, so they could make a matched placebo control drink, but you can buy concord grapes fresh, or tart cherries fresh, frozen, or water-packed in a can. I mix them with oatmeal, cocoa, and mint leaves for a chocolate-covered- cherry type sensation. You may want to try that for a few days before participating in your next big sporting event.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Every month I go live from my treadmill to answer your questions here on YouTube and on Facebook.

recommend colloidal silver in fact you can become silver poisoned by ingesting some people put it up their nose and you should not use silver internally you can get actually get a disease turns your skin strange color now is there a role for chloride or silver in topical applications outside the body perhaps in some rare circumstances of multi drug-resistant bacteria but that is not something that people should be using willy-nilly and certainly not internally I can't pronounce I'm so sorry I can't pronounce some of these names Joaquin so uh where'd you go okay stinky boom boom let's thank you boom boom asks I don't place a weird sticky boob no go I need to increase my the size of my chat window here okay I was so close to stinky boom-boom okay then it just disappeared I'm so sorry Ms boom-boom or mr. boom-boom okay I'm sorry I gotta go back to the bottom because it's growing up so quickly okay umm any story about BP and vegan Omar asks any story about BP blood pressure and a vegan diet absolutely I have a whole chapter on blood pressure in the book we've known since the nineteen twenties that high blood pressure need not occur my researchers measured the blood pressures at a thousand people living in rural Kenya published in The Lancet right of the most prestigious medical journal in the world 1929 and our blood pressures go up at we as we ate sets up a sixty the majority of us are hypertensive where is their eating a diet centered around fruits vegetables wild dark green leafy vegetables including and beans they're both pressures actually go down as they age in fact down to the ideal blood pressure so there's no benefit from reducing further blood pressure of 110 over 70 that's where we should all be working on and they got there naturally just eating healthy I miss anything with rural China 110 over 70 their entire lives 70 year old same average book pressures 16 year old and again what was you know what's the Venn diagram of the rural African nation diets it was plant-based that they need only not special occasions why do we things the plant-based nature their debts it was some protective because in the Western world according the American Heart Association the only folks getting it down that low are those eating strictly plant-based diets coming in average 110 over 65 so the to answer your question BP and vegan diets average 110 over 65 perfect ideal blood pressures so that's the nine people to go on and treat the cause if however you are on blood pressure medication you need to do this with supervision of your physician because they need to wrap it they may need to rapidly wean you off these blood pressure medications because you can't be on blood pressure man if you treat the call as eliminating our blood pressure can't be on blood pressure pills with normal blood pressure you drop your pressures too low you get dizzy fall over can hurt yourself so ironically the side effects are not having to take drugs or having to take fewer drugs so please work with your physician closely to wean yourself off these medications everything getting off completely and then not suffer the side effect and more importantly treat the cause of the disease okay any research on recovery for vegan athletes asked Ricky Kay with lots of question marks yeah I got a bunch of videos coming up on on on plant-based athletes and indeed that seems to be the key as the recovery time just because the anti-inflammatory nature of the diet it just allows people to to train that much harder but of course the secret is in the training not the diet the die just helps you enables you to train more but you still have to actually do the training no magic bullet all right Michael Stigall Stiggy Stigall SRU of course I'm to turn a treadmill on my walk about 17 miles a day of course tomorrow I'm gonna be in a plane on my butt all day but when I'm home if two of my diet roll of my life yes I'm on a treadmill day I'm working a treadmill desk I can you're a mound not tip to the camera down you'll see my well I don't know if you'll see then um that's my I got my keyboard I got my I got everything there um so yeah so then I can get work done does that actually show okay all right I knew I should have put pants on and yeah I'm treadmill because said being sedentary is not good for you even if you exercise even if you are you know go to the gym after work sitting down for six hours or more a day associated with living a significantly shorter lifespan I've got some videos about that check it out what is my input on the lemon first thing in the morning fine with me um I would just rinse your mouth out with water after eating that lemon or any citrus or any sour food so is not to a road your dental enamel okay Evan asks oh darn it Evan asked okay I'm not scroll up see if I'm ketchup yes should we limit soy intake I encouraged I think the sweet spot was three to five servings a day if I remember my own videos correctly because that high at two over five servings a day you can increase your levels of igf-1 insulin-like growth factor moments a cancer promoter growth hormone associated with animal protein consumption but enough soy protein you can get higher idea for on levels to which is not a good thing Elizabeth asks should humans fast that is a fantastic question there's a rich literature now I wanted to do fasting videos but there was just no science out there but now there's just been this burst of science and Clark restriction into meeting intermittent fasting water only fasting and also it's a really cool data and I can't wait to dig through and do a whole series of videos I hear you and the videos are coming subscribe at nutrition facts the bargain you will be the first to know when the first fasting video goes up alright how chloe Parker asks how do I feel about the work of ring Crowe nice I think Ray is a genius brilliant guy we share a lot of research anytime I come across a really interesting paper that I think would be helped it's work I send it to him he returns the favor he's got a book he's working a book called I think our broken plates something like that and I'm so excited for its release he's already published in the peer-reviewed medical Aries a former NASA engineer smart guy kind of reminds me of Pritikin right someone out of medical background just an engineering background and just wants to know the facts just show me the data and he's done a deep dive in the nutrition of literature and really has some fascinating stuff and I've done one video I think about his work I got a bunch more videos coming out about his work hey simple question as short films ABC macros what percentage the question is like should like 80/10/10 or what's the percentage of macronutrients from protein carbs and fat and the answer is it's the source that matters is dr. David Katz likes to say carbohydrates are lentils and lollipops so you can't say should eat more or less carbohydrates because what does that mean same thing with fat fat is lard if that is walnuts when the healthiest foods right you have talked about sources longer sources whole plant foods um I'm more interested with eating whole plant foods would then whether or not you're eating high or low fat or but you know so so as long as they're whole food source of fat and I talking about a while talking about and nuts seeds avocados those are health promoting foods I encourage people to eat up palmful actually uh nuts every day that's actually one of my daily doesn't another one is the tablespoon of ground flax seeds and so it's not it's fat good or bad it's the source whole food sources of fat carbs and protein or your best bet is okay t5 carrots a day ask Jackie it is okay to eat five carrots a day and even better dip those carrots and some bean dip or hummus or and time that you're making me hungry okay how can chem 2020s can your blood type dictate your eating habits I've got videos about the blood type diet or blood type astrology but that to me it seems the same as asking does my just my horoscope have anything to do with what I should eat and so the scientific community has been rightly very skeptical of that work and sees it more as a marketing gimmick than having any supportive at science um Maggie asked how can you increase your fertility actually very similar for both men and women it's eating a healthy plant-based diet though there was a the the Adventists too just had a sperm count diet that found I think that sperm counts of vegans was lower I have that that study doing everybody get just noted the the title abstract and I will do a video about it but in general I've got videos on fertility and low in saturated fat intake Siva soon someone in the plant-based would have improved fertility I will check out the study and letting you know what about a healthy vegan weight gain for strengthening athletes s Loukas so healthy if you add the word healthy in there then we're talking about whole plant foods um you know for athletes that are spending a lot of energy particularly swimmers they're just losing so much humanity EFT you know even thousands of extra calories a day you know that can be challenging on a plant-based diet because their foods are relatively clerkly dilute I mean you have to huge amounts of food now for most people that's a good thing it's hard just hard to get in excess of calories on a plant-based diet so great for weight loss but if you're actually trying to maintain a kind of endurance athlete my lifestyle where you know you're doing you know four or five thousand calories a day the way to do that is eat more eat more frequently even more calorically dense so we're talking nuts nut butters avocados smoothies you can kind of sneak liquid calories past your body and kind of fool the body a little bit so you know dried""), Document(metadata={'description': 'Every month I go live from my treadmill to answer your questions here on YouTube and on Facebook.

Michael Greger coming to you live from my treadmill as I do every month to answer your questions just spent some time on Facebook doing a live thing there and now here for the next half hour and then we'll do it again next month before to start taking questions let me just say that we are but one day from the end of our end-of-year a donation drive to help Bob of the 501 the 501 C 3 non-profit organization that runs nutrition facts that are if you would like to support my work please consider making a tax-deductible donation we are currently at let me we're in eighty nine point nine four percent let me refresh though hold on hold on nineteen point one nine percent all right we are but 9.81% to go to hit our data our goal by the end of the year so we are down to the wire hopefully you will help us out if you value what we do in nutrition facts are everything is free obviously no ads no corporate sponsorship strictly non-commercial not to sell anything just put up as a public service it's a labor of love as a tribute to my grandmother who's the reason that I do look what I do alright let us get to questions here all right here we go all right questions are pouring in I'll start with the top Oliver Hawk I asked what's the function Oh what's the function of the appendix Balaji teacher told me used to be for heavy plant digestion but due to switch to an omnivore kind of lost its function that is a good question we are not actually sure what the appendix is for but it is packed with immune tissue lymphoid tissue and so we think it may have something to do with immune function but certainly Berkut known as Berkut the famous one of our most famous medical figures of the last century for which burkas lymphoma is named after he's also well known for his his the fiber theory we talked about the well fiber may play in preventing some of the chronic diseases that were plaguing the Western world but were missing from the missionary hospitals they spent a lot of time from in sub-saharan Africa where he didn't find these epidemics of heart disease and obesity and diabetes and colon cancer and on down the list and appendicitis was actually one on those lists and thinks that that little if in cases of pendous itis you often find a it's called a fecal if a little stone of compacted feces blocking the entrance or the exit to the appendix and that's thought to cause the inflammation and so freed so maybe that's the reason why people eat high fiber diets who have more who have softer larger stool less constipation have lower rates of appendicitis who knows um I actually have a video coming up in on on fasting as a treatment for appendicitis for who they don't want to go into surgery not something I recommend but interesting case report as part of my long extended fasting series but that's enough on appendix thank you for your question um oh it's probably not Oliver probably Olivier sorry about that um Asik years so just says thanks Oh Olivier also says nearsightedness is less son to blame before our nearsightedness is there foods that may help with myopia it's a good question never looked into it um maybe because I couldn't see no um why is nearsightedness increasing I don't know good question I figured a pubmed.gov the database the largest medical library in the world and type in the myopia which is the kind named for your sadness and diet maybe you can find something and I'll do a video about it alright Olivier had was ready to go with all his questions as soon as the thing started smart person and next question was kissing girl kissing girlfriend causes irritation dry skin pimples ohh due to due to his stubbles idea of a treatment or prevention it's called shaving maybe and two more questions from Olivier do you have a database showing which paper oh oh which patient with papers you evaluated and tagged them um with various tags I mean I do have a database of all day let's see how bit I mean these are just the papers collected for 2017 which let's see there are high the database is sixty one point six one gig 75,000 177 PDFs but they are tagged but they're categorized not by by industry bias but by subject matter and finally Olivier says can't find much on whole food plant-based I had insisting fibrosis in the literature what do you think I only think what the literature says testing literature then I've got no opinion in fact I have no opinion about stuff in literature's just in the literature it's not um ah and though I haven't done specifically a search for cystic fibrosis and diet if anyone does find anything I would love to offer my advice on that not my advice just presenting the data in hopes that it might help somebody Chloe says maybe you can get me to talk about intermittent fasting ah interesting third person there I to talk about intermittent fasting I just haven't finished all my research on it so that's why I hesitate to talk but there is a huge boatload of data and looking forward to doing lots of videos about it Shauna asks oh isn't Shauna like Indian for chickpea I don't know maybe that's just I know well what a great name can you get all the omegas you need just with plant food such as Fox to Chia right there are two essential fats I'll make you threes make sixes make sixes basically found everywhere um so that's not a problem but make it threes in fact people get a lot to MIT to many mega sixes from these junky oils and processed foods like seed oil um but but we need our mega threes I mean that's something you could be relatively efficient in and most concentrated source and mega threes are our flax seeds in fact I'm just working on some flexi videos or all right now those I was doing this morning um flax seeds chia seeds walnuts hemp seeds I'm dirty vegetables have some even though that I'm a lot of fat but so but and so that is the short chain omega-3 called ethnic acid which our bodies can elongate into the long-chain omega-3s EPA & DHA the question is can it elongated enough for optimum health it's an unanswered research question about a bunch of videos about it I'm a but basically bottom line is may want to supplement you die with launched preformed long-chain omega-3s and not rely particularly as we get older on our body making enough for optimal cognitive health so I would recommend 250 milligrams of EPA in our DHA a day from pollutant free sources meaning algae based sources all right I said years raw vegan recovery asks what is my new book oh um so um how not to die cookbook just came out uh and hit the number 300 your Times bestsellers very very excited thanks to all your pre-orders um and so hopefully supposed lots of new people to eating healthy or eating evidence-based and so but my next book which going to start writing in March and currently a buffering out enough videos to be able to take off a year to write it on is going to be on obesity called how not to diet and looking very much forward to sitting down and working on that but it's just a massive project that's just I think there's 80,000 articles a year on obesity alone and so that's like that's a lot and so every day that goes by I get farther and farther behind so looking forward to jumping on that but I've got to do all the videos first how can we come up with this new compelling content all the time new video articles every day it's because we have hundreds literally hundreds of volunteers but we also have over a dozen paid staff that cost a lot of money and it's all just donation base kind of like Wikipedia everything's free but we count on the donations of people that just want to support our work feel it's useful for them valuable so you mean if 1000 people kicks in a few bucks we'd be all set since we reach so many millions of people even a dollar can help please got a nutrition facts that are click on the donate button we'd love your donations any time of the year this is just our final end of your push to get us set up for next year anyway alright next we did Chloe be there ok ochart is back saying mother worried about siblings missing nutrients from animal products can I give her a clear mind um and so there are only two vitamins um not made by animals well not made by plants um one is vitamin D made by animal such as yourself when you walk outside and get enough Sun at this time of the year though and the high enough in northern hemisphere the sun's rays err it's such an angle that I mean I'd be making enough vitamin D so I didn't curse mm unless you use a vitamin do you day regardless of what you eat and the other bother vitamin not made by plants is vitamin b12 norm a man will see there may have a little microbes that blink at the earth uh we may have been able to get all the b12 we need drinking out of a mountain stream of well water or something but not we chlorinated our water supply kill off any bacteria so don't get a lot of b12 in our water anymore don't get a lot of color either that's a good thing such a nice sanitary world but but it's critically important anyone eating a plant-based diet to get a regular reliable source of vitamin b12 our fellow great apes get all the b12 they need eating bugs dirt and feces I prefer a supplement so twenty-five hundred micrograms Bionicle bomb and chips for my b12 one so we gots less than five bucks here get all the b12 you need and there you go all right um Julia asks what foods are best for the brain how can I best keep my green healthy berries berries for the berries for the wind and so there was you know this famous Harvard nurses study I found that berry eaters it's just a few servings a week of blueberries or strawberries though women eating berries compared to non berry eaters or infrequent very eaters had a delay had their basically their their cognitive function was two and a half years younger so they kind of delayed brain aging by two and a half years that was an observational study though I'm so it's possible maybe berry eaters were just healthier in""), Document(metadata={'description': 'Live Q&A on July 26th\n\nSubscribe to my free nutrition newsletter at

Greger okay please tell them about the best plant-based strategy for bad arthritis okay so the question is what kind of arthritis do you have mentioned that there was a family history so room well I would guess it doesn't really matter rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis actually very similar diet seems to help with both a diet packed with anti-inflammatory foods might so whole food plant-based diet we have decent date on rheumatoid arthritis at least knee osteoarthritis there's not much on certain other types of arthritis like ankylosing spondylitis but I certainly can't hurt seems a nice healthy anti-inflammatory diet but as always got treat the cause there she affects just causes that that don't need diet they need antibiotics so you need to find out what's causing arthritis and hopefully try to to treat the cause although a healthy diet will help regardless with your life because it's a healthy diet elite a lean e Li any and asks what is the best strategy for going out birth control pill previously covered in very persistent acne after quitting usually that's temporary and should kind of equilibrate or at least has been in my experience innocent lamb looked into I do have some videos on treating acne like with barberries I was just talking about in the other on the other QA but again I don't know if there's some protocol that would make that less likely Louis Mahon as how often do we need to replenish antioxidant levels so it makes sense to put some amla powder in glass and water I bring to bed and sit during the night um you don't have this really and what I found to be intriguing serious Nvidia on like what's your RDA for antioxidants like what's the recommended daily allowance I think it's a series of three videos where I talk about how the targets for men and women in terms of how my on antioxidant unisys you get every day and then I go through all the different foods all right well if when you did 15,000 or whatever how you gonna do it okay here's your oatmeal this is where you get to and if you had a little cinnamon boof all of a sudden you're up to here and there's and then so I check out those videos I bet if you take just type in antioxidants into nutrition facts that are hard we actually just updated our search engine and this month I think last month so it's really much nicer than it used to be Thank You Christy and so you should be able to find those those series of videos on exactly how much you need how to reach it and as you'll see in those videos it's super easy to do it but you just have to eat really healthy foods so no there's no reason you need to sip on some special glass of Amla water you can get all the antioxidants you need from foods if you eat healthy enough and those videos will help you do that emcee sebastian asks is five milligrams melatonin supplements daily long-term safe there's so much scientific evidence about benefits but their concern that hormones declining as age do not take notes supplements um y-you say well just trust me until the video the videos already I don't know I can look it up I'm let me see if it's in then this next batch of videos um volume we're up to volume 43 can you believe that oh yeah here it is video 4319 our melatonin supplements safe alright so where are we now oh we are on three so in 16 videos 16 videos from today our melatonin supplements safe so you can see all the data and why but spoiler it cut to the chase don't take melatonin supplements you'll find out in 16 videos all right hacks I'm 21 says please talk about 9 Jen I've never heard of night Jen can't talk about it hex I'm 21 says or NAD+ I can talk about I'd presumably as a supplement my NAD+ is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide i think that it's a coenzyme in the body your body makes it you don't need to eat it no reason take supplement but I bet the people that are trying to sell you NAD+ have a different opinion Louis Mellon says is there any evidence eating in season foods is healthier or that like different ethnic groups are particularly suited for different foods and the answer is no no I guess n-no so in season foods well so there may be environmental benefits too you know buying locally in season but but if you just care about your health the fact that we can eat blueberries all year round without even having to get you be probably fresh blueberries all year round I'm so of course you can just see some frozen that's a wonderful thing about our modern world and that you know I have to do live off of like turnips during the winter and so yeah eat healthy foods all year-round period would be my take on that in terms of ethnic groups eating different foods I mean it's remarkable that around the world people eat vastly different diets but you know but the reason we know that people aren't somehow kind of their genetics have something new it is because of these migration studies where you take people I take someone lives in Japan they moved to San Francisco even living like a San Franciscan and they start dying from all these San Francisco diseases and less of these so they you know their prostate cancer rates shoot up if their man the but their stomach cancer rates you down this all the sudden they're not dating all this little salted fermented veggies that they were eating in Japan anyway so no we we're all humans and healthy food is healthy food regardless of what kind of human you are e Moana Beach says one of the best ways to increase saliva Munna says talks about a dry mouth due to anxiety and so the pureed foods liquids and I try the food I hold my breath is alive isn't breaking down can help okay increase love so what I would do is whether it's actually conditioned there's a variety of conditions that can actually cause dry mouth and so there's person salivary glands or section now the muta C's that can do it seem to go to your doctor find out what it is so you can treat the cause and if it is anxiety then there's things you can do to treat anxiety so it's not about well I'm just gonna eat lots of wet food no let's treat the cause find out what's causing the first place treat that so then you can eat any kind of healthy food you want um okay um una asks how to breathe when there's no air gets into distress sounds like an like hangs a panic attack uh yeah it sounds like a panic attack but you need to go get treated for panic attacks it's a horrible horrible sensation unfortunately I don't think there's anything there's been no studies I'm aware of on diet and panic attacks no there are one can imagine lifestyle interventions something like stress management maybe meditation things like that things which I am no expert and so I am not familiar with that literature but hopefully on your physician can point you in the right direction Maria ve asked top recommendation for vegan protein when trying to work out build muscles trainers recommending protein shakes but smart Maria would prefer to avoid processed food can you imagine anything more process than protein powder it's like everything's been removed except the grunting and then of course they add also it's a crap in and hope I'll visit can begin on coming up to Toronto soon so anyway yeah what's the best way to get vegan protein I weigh beans right anyone doesn't know how to get protein on a plant-based diet doesn't know beans""), Document(metadata={'description': 'Cocoa and nitrite-rich vegetables, such as green leafies and beets, are put to the test for cognitive function.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter

However, little evidence on its role in human brain function existed... until it was put to the test. Feed people lots of green leafy vegetables with some beet juice to boot, and then measure cerebral blood flow. See that spot there with improved flow? That’s a critical brain area known to be involved in executive functioning. OK, but improved blood flow doesn’t necessarily translate into improved cognitive function. For example, feed people tart cherries, and despite some indication of improved blood flow, this didn’t appear to manifest as improved cognitive performance. And indeed, some of the initial studies were disappointing. Give people over a cup of cooked spinach and no immediate boost in the ability to carry out simple tasks, but that may be because the tests weren’t hard enough. Give people a similar battery of simple tasks after consuming cocoa and no significant effect. But put people through a more demanding set of tasks, and you can see acute improvements in cognitive performance after cocoa consumption. The tasks they’re talking about is like counting backwards in 3’s for minutes at a time. What if you tried doing that same thing after drinking two cups of organic beet juice, which has about the same amount of nitrate as two cups of cooked arugula? Significantly improved performance, in terms of more correct answers on the sustained subtraction task. These results suggest that a single dose of nitrate-rich vegetables can modify brain function, and that this is likely to be as a result of increased nitric oxide synthesis. OK,  but how do we know it’s the nitrate? Beets are packed with all sorts of phytonutrients like the betalain red pigment. One way to tease it out would be to come up with some kind of nitrate- depleted beet juice— has all the other stuff in beets, but just missing the nitrate— to see if that works just as well, and that’s exactly what researchers did. They developed a nitrate- depleted beetroot juice placebo. And compared to that, within two weeks of supplementation with the real stuff this group of diabetics got a significant improvement in reaction time. Now we’re just talking 13 milliseconds here, but other interventions like balance training that only increased reaction time like 7 milliseconds were associated with significantly lower fall risk. And of course, in athletes, those fractions of a second can sometimes make a difference. At very high exercise intensities, cognitive task performance deteriorates, with a pronounced detrimental effect on reaction time, and that may be just when you need it the most. Like you\'re playing football or something and need to make rapid appropriate decisions while simultaneously going all out. And once again, beets to the rescue, significantly reducing reaction time; so, not only improving physical performance but mental performance as well. Yeah, but can it improve the structure of your brain? Things like cognitive training and aerobic exercise can actually affect the structure of the human brain. There’s something called neuroplasticity, where your brain can adapt, changing its configuration as you like learn to play piano or something. We used to think only younger brains could do this, but now we know it can occur in the aging brain as well. Can’t “beet” that—or can you? We didn\'t know… until now. Here’s your brain before and after a six-week exercise program, measuring connectivity between various parts of your brain that control movement. No big change. But, what about the same amount of exercise before… and after drinking some beet juice too? Big difference. The exercise plus beetroot juice group developed brain networks that more closely resembled those of younger adults, showing the potential enhanced neuroplasticity conferred by combining exercise and nitrate-rich vegetables.')]","For someone working long hours and needing to maintain energy and improve focus, it's essential to choose foods that provide sustained energy and support cognitive function. Here are some recommendations based on Dr. Michael Greger's insights from NutritionFacts.org:

1. **Nuts and Berries**: These are considered excellent brain foods. Berries, such as blueberries and strawberries, have been observed to help delay cognitive aging and improve memory due to their high antioxidant content. Nuts, like walnuts, are beneficial for cognitive performance and critical thinking. They are also a good source of healthy fats, protein, and fiber, which can help sustain energy levels throughout the day.

2. **Whole Grains**: Foods like oats or whole wheat pasta provide a good source of complex carbohydrates, which are essential for sustained energy. They help maintain stable blood sugar levels, preventing spikes and crashes that can affect your focus and energy.

3. **Leafy Greens and Beets**: Consuming nitrate-rich vegetables such as spinach, kale, and beets can enhance cognitive performance and brain function. These foods help increase blood flow to the brain, which is crucial for maintaining cognitive abilities and focus.

4. **Legumes and Beans**: These are excellent sources of protein and fiber, which can help keep you feeling full and energized. They also provide essential nutrients that support overall health and brain function.

5. **Fruits**: Snacking on fruits like apples, bananas, or oranges can provide a quick source of natural sugar and fiber, offering a boost of energy without the crash associated with processed sugars.

6. **Hydration**: Staying well-hydrated is crucial for maintaining energy and focus. Water is ideal, but other hydrating fluids like herbal teas can also be beneficial.

7. **Cocoa**: Dark chocolate or cocoa can be beneficial for cognitive function. Cocoa is rich in flavonoids, which have been shown to enhance brain function and mood.

By incorporating these foods into your diet, you can help ensure sustained energy levels and improved focus during long working hours. It's also beneficial to maintain regular meal times and include a variety of nutrient-dense foods to support overall health.","For someone working long hours and needing to maintain energy and improve focus, it's essential to choose foods that provide sustained energy and support cognitive function.

They’re just talking about associations, meaning berry eaters and nut eaters tend to have better brain function as they age after trying to control for a bunch of other lifestyle factors, but you don’t know if it’s cause and effect... until you put it to the test. Thankfully, we now have a growing number of interventional studies that have done just that. Randomized controlled trials where people eat berries or nuts and you can prove it— actually show improvements in cognitive performance, raising the berry nutty idea that we may be able to forestall or reverse the effects of neurodegeneration in aging with food. For example, this study on the effects of walnut consumption on cognitive performance. College students split up into groups doing two months of walnuts followed by two months of placebo or vice versa and then they switch. How do you make a placebo nut? They baked it in. They gave people banana bread with or without nuts; same ingredients, just one with walnuts, and those on the nuts showed a significant improvement in “inference capacity,” the ability to accurately draw conclusions from a set of facts, in other words, critical thinking. And so, on a practical level, maybe students or young professionals in fields that involve a great deal of critical thinking or decision-making could possibly benefit and gain a slight advantage through regular consumption of walnuts. Or this berry study, where they randomized folks to some crazy berry smoothie with blueberries, black currants, elderberries, lingonberries, strawberries, and…  a tomato. And not only did their bad cholesterol drop about 10 points, they performed better on short-term memory tests; so, good for the heart, good for the brain. And not just better on like pencil-and-paper tests, but real-world applications. Give people concord grape juice versus some fake grape Kool-Aid-type placebo, and you get improved performance on everyday tasks—like quicker response times in driving tests. Why not just give people concord grapes instead of juice? Well, then, it’s harder to create a placebo and, of course, the study was paid for by Welch’s. OK, fruit and nuts, what about vegetables? Consumers of cruciferous vegetables, like cabbage, cauliflower, kale, collards, broccoli and Brussels sprouts, have been found to perform better in several cognitive tests than non-users. In terms of cognitive decline with aging, women consuming the most green leafies did better, effectively slowing brain aging a year or two, and not just cruciferous, but other dark green leafies like spinach; so, maybe it’s the nitrates. As we age, our cerebral blood flow drops, the amount of blood flowing through our brain, which may be due to an age-related decrease in the production of nitric oxide, the open sesame molecule that dilates our blood vessels and is boosted by the consumption of nitrate-rich vegetables. This reduction in blood flow to the brain may be a major risk factor for the impairment of cognitive function and development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as dementia. We know nitrate-rich vegetables like leafy greens and beets can improve physiological performance, like beet juice does for athletes, but what about cognitive performance?

But out of the 21 studies they could find in the medical literature, they were only able to find one randomized controlled trial, considered the study design that provides the highest level of evidence. And it was the study I profiled in ""Improving Mood Through Diet"", in which removing meat, fish, poultry and eggs improved several mood scores in just two weeks. We\'ve known those eating plant-based tend to have healthier mood states— less tension, anxiety, depression, anger, hostility and fatigue, but you couldn\'t tell if it was cause and effect until you put it to the test, which they finally did. But what could account for such rapid results? Well, eating vegetarian does give you a better antioxidant status, which may help with depression. Also, as I\'ve previously addressed, how consumption of even a single carbohydrate-rich meal can improve depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, fatigue, alertness, and calmness scores among patients with PMS, but what about long term? Overweight men and women were randomized into a low carb, high fat diet or high carb, low fat diet for a year. By the end of the year, who had less depression, anxiety, anger and hostility, feelings of dejection, tension, fatigue, better vigor, less confusion or mood disturbances? The low carb dieters are represented by the black circles, and the low fat dieters are represented in the white. These sustained improvements in mood in the low fat group compared with the low carb group are consistent with results from epidemiological studies showing that diets high in carbohydrate and low in fat and protein are associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression and have beneficial effects on psychological well-being. The overall amount of fat in their diet didn\'t change in this study, though. But the type of fat did. Their arachidonic acid intake fell to zero. Arachidonic acid is an inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid that can adversely impact mental health via a cascade of neuroinflammation. It may inflame our brain. High blood levels in the bloodstream have been associated with a greater likelihood of suicide risk, for example, and major depressive episodes. How can we stay away from the stuff? Well, Americans are exposed to arachidonic acid primarily through chicken and eggs. But when you remove chicken and eggs, and other meat, we can eliminate preformed arachidonic acid from our diet. So while high-quality treatment studies investigating the impact of diet on depression are scarce, there is that successful 2-week trial, but even better: How about 22 weeks? Overweight or diabetic employees of a major insurance corporation received either weekly group instruction on a whole food plant-based diet or no diet instruction for five and a half months. There was no portion size restriction, no calorie counting, no carb counting. No change in exercise. No meals were provided, but the company cafeteria did start offering daily options such as lentil soup, minestrone, bean burritos. No meat, eggs, dairy, oil or junk, yet they reported greater diet satisfaction compared with the control group participants who had no diet restrictions. How\'d they do though? More participants in the plant-based intervention group reported improved digestion, increased energy, better sleep than usual at week 22 compared with the control group. They also reported a significant increase in physical functioning, general health, vitality, and mental health. Here are the results  presented graphically, where the plant-based group beat out controls on nearly every measure. There was also significant improvements in work productivity, thought to be due in large part to their improvements in health. So what this study demonstrated was that a cholesterol-free diet is acceptable, not only in research settings, but in a typical corporate environment, improving quality of life and productivity at little cost. All we need now is a large, randomized trial for confirmation, but we didn\'t have such a thing, until now. Ten corporate sites across the country from San Diego to Macon, Georgia. Same kind of set up as before. Can a plant-based nutrition program in a multi-center, corporate setting improve depression, anxiety, and productivity? Yes. Significant improvements in depression, anxiety, fatigue, emotional well being, and daily functioning. Lifestyle interventions have an increasingly apparent role in physical and mental health, and among the most effective of these is the use of plant-based diets.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'The most comprehensive controlled trial of diet and mood finds that a plant-based nutrition program in a workplace setting across ten corporate sites significantly improves depression, anxiety, and productivity.\n\nThis is part of our Flashback Friday series, and originally aired in 2015.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

But out of the 21 studies they could find in the medical literature, they were only able to find one randomized controlled trial, considered the study design that provides the highest level of evidence. And it was the study I profiled in ""Improving Mood Through Diet"", in which removing meat, fish, poultry and eggs improved several mood scores in just two weeks. We\'ve known those eating plant-based tend to have healthier mood states— less tension, anxiety, depression, anger, hostility and fatigue, but you couldn\'t tell if it was cause and effect until you put it to the test, which they finally did. But what could account for such rapid results? Well, eating vegetarian does give you a better antioxidant status, which may help with depression. Also, as I\'ve previously addressed, how consumption of even a single carbohydrate-rich meal can improve depression, tension, anger, confusion, sadness, fatigue, alertness, and calmness scores among patients with PMS, but what about long term? Overweight men and women were randomized into a low carb, high fat diet or high carb, low fat diet for a year. By the end of the year, who had less depression, anxiety, anger and hostility, feelings of dejection, tension, fatigue, better vigor, less confusion or mood disturbances? The low carb dieters are represented by the black circles, and the low fat dieters are represented in the white. These sustained improvements in mood in the low fat group compared with the low carb group are consistent with results from epidemiological studies showing that diets high in carbohydrate and low in fat and protein are associated with lower levels of anxiety and depression and have beneficial effects on psychological well-being. The overall amount of fat in their diet didn\'t change in this study, though. But the type of fat did. Their arachidonic acid intake fell to zero. Arachidonic acid is an inflammatory omega-6 fatty acid that can adversely impact mental health via a cascade of neuroinflammation. It may inflame our brain. High blood levels in the bloodstream have been associated with a greater likelihood of suicide risk, for example, and major depressive episodes. How can we stay away from the stuff? Well, Americans are exposed to arachidonic acid primarily through chicken and eggs. But when you remove chicken and eggs, and other meat, we can eliminate preformed arachidonic acid from our diet. So while high-quality treatment studies investigating the impact of diet on depression are scarce, there is that successful 2-week trial, but even better: How about 22 weeks? Overweight or diabetic employees of a major insurance corporation received either weekly group instruction on a whole food plant-based diet or no diet instruction for five and a half months. There was no portion size restriction, no calorie counting, no carb counting. No change in exercise. No meals were provided, but the company cafeteria did start offering daily options such as lentil soup, minestrone, bean burritos. No meat, eggs, dairy, oil or junk, yet they reported greater diet satisfaction compared with the control group participants who had no diet restrictions. How\'d they do though? More participants in the plant-based intervention group reported improved digestion, increased energy, better sleep than usual at week 22 compared with the control group. They also reported a significant increase in physical functioning, general health, vitality, and mental health. Here\'s this kind of represented graphically, where the plant-based group beat out controls on nearly every measure. There was also significant improvements in work productivity, thought to be due in large part to their improvements in health. So what this study demonstrated was that a cholesterol-free diet is acceptable, not only in research settings, but in a typical corporate environment, improving quality of life and productivity at little cost. All we need now is a large, randomized trial for confirmation, but we didn\'t have such a thing, until now. Ten corporate sites across the country from San Diego to Macon, Georgia. Same kind of set up as before. Can a plant-based nutrition program in a multi-center, corporate setting improve depression, anxiety, and productivity? Yes. Significant improvements in depression, anxiety, fatigue, emotional well being, and daily functioning. Lifestyle interventions have an increasingly apparent role in physical and mental health, and among the most effective of these is the use of plant-based diets.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'IMPORTANT NOTE: Though the observational data does appear rife (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFOOzHKXCxw) with reverse causation, a new study (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02223-9.epdf) published interventional data in mice and in vitro on 2/27/23 that suggests erythritol may indeed be harmful, and so I urge everyone to stop consuming it until we know more.\n \nAn industry-funded randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial study suggests chocolate may improve symptoms for those suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome, a debilitating condition currently affecting as many as 7 million Americans.

We don’t even have a good idea of how many people even have it. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that as many as seven and a half million Americans currently suffer from it. And we as physicians have very little to offer patients in terms of relieving those symptoms. So, this is one of the conditions that I’m always keeping an eye out for in terms of new treatments. And one of the latest they just discovered? Chocolate. Evidently, Montezuma the Second, who reigned the Aztec empire 500 years ago, noted: “This divine drink, which builds up resistance, and fights fatigue. A cup of [cocoa] permits people to walk for a whole day without food.’’ Not willing to take the emperor’s word for it, it was put to the test. I’m always skeptical of industry-supported research, but it was actually a pretty good study. At first glance, it looked like they were basically saying eat three chocolate bars a day for eight weeks, and call me in the morning. But it was actually a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial, which is about as good as you can get. The mad scientists over at Nestle took white chocolate, dyed it brown, and then added some sort of fake chocolate flavor, such that people couldn’t tell if they were eating the real chocolate or the fake. Comparable amounts of sugar and fat, but one had cocoa solids— phytonutrients—and the other basically didn’t. So, they were able to put people on one, and then switch them over, without anyone knowing, to see if their chronic fatigue symptoms got better or worse. And there was a significant improvement in the real chocolate group, meaning it apparently wasn’t just the yummy taste of chocolate, but the action of the cacao phytonutrients. Of course, no one should be eating three chocolate bars a day, but you can get the equivalent dose of cocoa solids, the equivalent dose of those wonderful cocoa phytonutrients, by consuming two and a half tablespoons of cocoa powder a day. You can put it in coffee, you can make a chocolaty smoothie, or, my personal favorite, you can blend it in a high-speed blender with frozen cherries or strawberries, a touch of non-dairy milk, vanilla extract, and some erythritol or some dates, and you have instant, decadent chocolate ice cream; low-fat, low-calorie, no cholesterol, no added sugar chocolate ice cream. The more you eat, the healthier you are— whether or not you’re suffering from chronic fatigue.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Studies dating back to the 30s found that by hooking athletes on a treadmill up to an IV drip of sugar water, you could delay fatigue, and that drinking sugar water could help as well. So, the sports supplement industry has come up with an array of energy drinks, shots, gels, bars, chews— even sports jelly beans, used (what a coincidence!), by the Jelly Belly Cycling Team. In fact, the Jelly Belly Candy Company paid for a study that found that said sports jellybeans could shave four or five seconds off of a 10K cycling trial, compared to sports drinks or gels. But, what about compared to raisins? Given that “professional, collegiate, and recreational sporting events are supplement centered and heavily marketed to, athletes at all levels may be left with the impression that ‘specially designed’ supplements are essential for optimal performance. Yet, these products are often expensive and cheaper, natural foods that may provide a healthier alternative are often overlooked. There are low-cost, natural food products rich in [carbs], such as sun-dried raisins… that have the potential to improve performance to a similar degree. [R]aisins are nutritious, convenient, typically palatable, and are a cost-effective source of [concentrated carbohydrates].” But, do they work as well? They work exactly as well. Exact same time. Same thing comparing raisins to a commercial sports gel— same respiratory exchange, same carb and fat oxidation, same energy expenditure. In fact, the only significant difference between raisins and jelly beans was in “hedonic scores”— pleasantness scoring— and, raisins beat out the jelly beans. Compared to jelly beans with flavors like “Extreme Watermelon,” there was a greater preference for just raisin-flavored raisins.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'What are the effects of spinach and berries on oxidative stress, inflammation, and muscle soreness in athletes?\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

What about the consumption of fruit and vegetables and risk of frailty in the elderly? Higher fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with lower frailty as well, in a dose-response manner, meaning more fruit less frailty, and more vegetables too, but these were all observational studies, which can’t alone prove cause-and-effect. What happens when you  put foods to the test? Well, no positive influence ingesting chia seed oil on human running performance, but there was an effect found for spinach supplementation on exercise-induced oxidation stress. And by spinach supplementation, they meant they just gave some guys some fresh raw spinach leaves, one gram per kilo, so like a quarter of a bunch a day for two weeks and then they had them  run a half marathon. And, they found that “chronic daily oral supplementation of spinach,” uh meaning like eating a salad, has alleviating effects on known markers of oxidative stress and muscle damage, Here’s what happens when you run a half marathon without spinach: a big spike in oxidative stress, blood malondealdehyde levels, that stay up hours or even days later. In the spinach group, the before and after 2 weeks of spinach doesn’t seem to make much of a difference, but put the body under pressure, and then you can really see the difference. Your body is better able to deal with the stress. And, if you look at the resulting muscle damage, as measured by creatine kinase  leakage from your muscles (that\'s an enzyme that should  be in your muscles, not leaking out into your blood), you start out at about 100 and go up to 200 after the half marathon, right after, 2 hours later. But it’s the next day where you really feel it, that delayed onset muscle soreness, with CK levels reaching 600 before coming back down. Okay, that’s without spinach, though. On spinach, you get a similar immediate post-race bump, but it’s that next day where spinach really shines. You don’t get that same next-day spike, and so, for a competitive athlete, that quicker recovery may get you back training harder sooner. They attribute this to the anti- inflammatory effects of spinach. Same with black currant juice. After some hardcore weight lifting, muscle damage indicators  go up and stay up, whereas the same lifting drinking berries, and it goes up, but  comes right back down. But these were just measures of a biomarker of muscle soreness. What about actual soreness? If you look at the effects of tart cherry juice on recovery following prolonged, intermittent sprints in soccer players, you see the same kind of reduction in biomarkers of inflammation, but more importantly, less resulting muscle soreness. Here’s the soreness reported in the days afterwards in the placebo group. Only about half in the cherry group. Then, they measured maximum voluntary isometric contractions of the leg muscles, which understandably took a hit in the days after the intense workout, but not in the cherry group. They conclude that participants supplemented with a tart cherry concentrate were able to maintain greater  functional performance. But, that was testing like how high can you vertically jump. They didn’t actually see if they played soccer any better. But, this study on purple grape juice actually showed an ergogenic effect in recreational runners by promoting increased time to exhaustion, where you ramp people up on a treadmill and see how long they  can go before collapsing. After a month of drinking a grape Kool-Aid type placebo control drink, no real change in performance, but a whopping 15% improvement in the real grape group– hung on for another 12 minutes. They used juice, so they could make a matched placebo control drink, but you can buy concord grapes fresh, or tart cherries fresh, frozen, or water-packed in a can. I mix them with oatmeal, cocoa, and mint leaves for a chocolate-covered- cherry type sensation.

BDNF controls the growth of new nerve cells, and “so, low levels [may explain the] atrophy of specific brain areas… [you see] among depressed patients.” That may be one of the reasons exercise is so good for our brains. Start an hour-a-day exercise regimen, and within three months you can get a quadrupling of BDNF release from your brain. This makes sense. Any time we were desperate to catch prey or desperate not to become prey ourselves, we needed to be cognitively sharp. And so, when we’re fasting or exercising and in a negative calorie balance, our brain starts churning out BDNF to make sure we’re firing on all cylinders. So, of course Big Pharma is eager to create drugs to mimic this effect, but is there any way to boost BDNF naturally? Yes, I just said it— fasting and exercise! Okay, okay, but is there anything we can add to our diet to boost BDNF? Well, higher intakes of dietary flavonoids appear to be protectively associated with symptoms of depression. The Harvard Nurse’s Study followed tens of thousands of women for years and found that those who were eating the most appeared to reduce their risk of coming down with depression. Flavonoids occur naturally in plants, and so there’s a substantial amount in a variety of healthy foods. But wait…how do we know the benefits are from the flavonoids and not just from eating healthier in general? You don’t know until you ... put it to the test. See, some fruits and vegetables have more than others. Apples have more than apricots, plums more than peaches, red cabbage more than white, kale more than cucumbers. So, if you randomize people into one of three groups: more high-flavonoid fruits and vegetables, more low-flavonoid fruits and vegetables, or no extra fruits and vegetables at all, after 18 weeks, only the high-flavonoid group got a significant boost in BDNF levels, which corresponded to an improvement in cognitive performance. The BDNF boost may help explain why each additional daily serving of fruits and  vegetables is associated with a three percent decrease in the risk of depression. A teaspoon a day of the spice turmeric may boost BDNF levels more than 50 percent within a month, consistent with the other randomized controlled trials that have so far been done. Nuts may help too. In the PREDIMED study where people were randomized to be sent weekly batches of nuts or extra virgin olive oil, the nut group lowered their risk of having low BDNF levels by 78 percent. And brain-derived neurotrophic factor is not just implicated in depression but schizophrenia as well. Have those with schizophrenia undergo a 12-week exercise program and they get a significant boost in BDNF levels, leading the researchers to suggest “that exercise induced modulation of BDNF may play an important role in developing non-pharmacological treatment for chronic schizophreni[a] patients.” Okay, but what actually happened to their schizophrenia symptoms? Let’s find out. Thirty individuals with schizophrenia randomized to ramp up to 40 minutes of aerobic exercise three times a week or not. And there did appear to be an improvement in psychiatric symptoms such as hallucinations, as well as increasing their quality of life. In fact, you can actually visualize what happened in their brains. Loss of brain volume in a certain region appears to be a feature of schizophrenia, but 30 minutes of exercise three times a week and you can get up to a 20 percent increase in size of that region within three months. Calorie restriction may also increase BDNF levels in schizophrenics, but they didn’t just have them eat less, but eat healthier— less saturated fat and sugar, and more fruits and veggies. It’s like the Soviet fasting trials for schizophrenia. They reported these truly unbelievable results, supposedly restoring people to function, fasting described as an “unparalleled achievement in the treatment of schizophrenia”. Okay, but part of the problem is that the diagnostic system the Soviets used is completely different, making any results hard to interpret. But they do have a subgroup that does seem to correspond to the Western definition, and they still report between 40 and 60 percent improvement rates from fasting. But that\'s not all they did. After being fasted for up to a month, they were put on a meat and egg-free diet, so when they report these remarkable effects even years later, that’s for those who stuck with the diet. Those who broke the diet evidently relapsed, and the closer the diet was followed the better the effect. They note that “not all patients [were able to] remain vegetarian,” but they tried to keep meat to a minimum. And look, we know from randomized controlled trials that just removing meat and eggs can improve mental states within even just two weeks, and so it’s hard to know what role the fasting itself played in the reported improvements. A single high-fat meal can drop BDNF levels within hours. And you can prove it’s the fat itself by seeing the same thing injecting fat straight into their veins. Perhaps that helps explain why increased consumption of saturated fats in a high-fat diet may contribute to brain dysfunction— neurodegenerative diseases, long-term memory loss, cognitive impairment. Maybe that helps explain why the standard American diet has been linked to a higher risk of depression, dietary factors modulating the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Mood-boosting foods: A randomized controlled trial investigates diet and psychological well-being.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

That's the focus of an emerging field of positive psychology focusing on happiness, life satisfaction, and flourishing, which may translate to physical benefits such as improvements in blood pressure, immune function, and longevity. What is the contribution of food consumption to well-being? Well, studies have linked the consumption of fruits and vegetables with enhanced well-being. A systematic review of research found evidence that consuming fruits and vegetables was associated with increased psychological well-being. Okay, but that's just an association. A famous criticism in this area of research is that maybe there's just some inherent personality trait or type of family upbringing that might lead people simultaneously to eat in a healthy way, and also to have better mental well-being. So the diet is merely correlated with, but incorrectly gives the appearance of helping to cause the level of well-being. But recent research circumvented this problem by seeing if changes in diet are correlated with changes in mental well-being, in effect studying the evolution of well-being and happiness after increases in the consumption of fruits and vegetables. And look at that graph—a straight-line increase between how much more fruits and veggies people started eating and their change in life satisfaction over time. Increased fruit and vegetable consumption appeared predictive of increased happiness, life satisfaction, and well-being— up to 0.24 life-satisfaction points for an increase of eight portions a day. What does that mean? Is that a lot? Is that a little? That's a lot, equal in size to the psychological gain of going from unemployed to getting a job. My Daily Dozen recommendation is for at least nine servings of fruits and veggies a day. This study was done in Australia. It was repeated in the UK, and researchers there found the same thing, though the Brits may need to bump up their daily minimum to more like 10 or 11 servings a day. Okay, but does eating fruits and veggies also reduce the risk of depression and anxiety? I mean well-being is nice, but governments and medical authorities are often interested in the determinants of major mental illness, not life satisfaction. And indeed, using the same data set but instead looking for mental illness, eating fruits and vegetables may help to protect against future risk of clinical depression and anxiety as well. A systematic review and meta- analysis of dozens of studies found that every 100-gram increased intake of fruit was associated with a 3% reduced risk of depression. That's about half an apple, yet less than 10% of most Western populations even consume a bare minimum. Maybe the problem is we're just telling people about the long-term benefits of fruit intake for chronic disease prevention, rather than the near-immediate improvements in well-being. So maybe we should be advertising the happiness gains, but first we need to make sure they're real. We've been talking about associations. Yes, a healthy diet may reduce the risk of future depression or anxiety, but being diagnosed with depression or anxiety today could also lead to lower fruit and vegetable intake. Now, in these studies you can indeed show that the increase in fruit and vegetable consumption came first, and not the other way around, but as the great enlightenment philosopher pointed out, just because the cock crows before the dawn doesn't mean the cock caused the sun to rise. To prove cause-and-effect you need to put it to the test with an interventional study. Unfortunately, to date many studies were like this, where those randomized to eat fruit showed significant improvements in anxiety and depression, fatigue, and emotional distress. Wow, amazing! But that was compared to chocolate and potato chips. Apples, clementines, and bananas making people feel better than assorted potato chips and chunky chocolate wafers—not exactly a revelation. This is the kind of study I've been waiting for: a randomized controlled trial in which young adults were randomized to a diet-as-usual group, encouragement to eat more fruits and veggies, or a third group given two servings of fruits and vegetables a day to eat over and above their regular diet. And the ones given fruits and veggies showed improvements in their psychological well-being with increases in vitality, flourishing, and motivation within just two weeks! However, simply educating people to eat their fruits and vegetables may not be enough to reap the full rewards, so perhaps greater emphasis needs to be placed on actually providing people with fresh produce, for example, offering free fruit for people when they shop. I know that would certainly make me happy!""), Document(metadata={'description': ""Certain foods are linked to not only increased happiness, but great “eudaemonic” well-being, feelings of engagement, creativity, meaning, and purpose in life. \n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Thousands of papers have been published on the important topic of what determines people’s happiness and psychological health, but what about the potential influence of the different kinds of foods that people eat? The rising prevalence of mental ill health is causing a considerable burden, and so inexpensive and effective strategies are required to improve the psychological well-being of our population. And now we have a growing body of literature suggesting that dietary intake may have the potential to influence psychological well-being. Dietary intake of what? Well, given the strong evidence base for the health benefits of fruits and vegetables, researchers started there. Cross-sectional studies from all over the world support this relationship between happiness and fruit and vegetable intake. Those eating fruits and vegetables each day had a higher likelihood of being classified as “very happy"", suggesting a strong and positive correlation between fruit and vegetable consumption and happiness. Perhaps feelings of optimism, too. The largest such study was done in Great Britain, where a dose–response relationship was found between daily servings of fruits and vegetables and both life satisfaction and happiness, meaning more fruits and veggies meant more happiness. People who got up to seven or eight servings a day reported the highest life satisfaction and happiness. And these associations remained significant even after controlling for factors such as income and illness and exercise, smoking and body weight, suggesting fruit and vegetable consumption wasn’t just acting as a marker for other healthy behaviors. But how could eating plants improve happiness on their own? Well, many fruits and veggies contain higher levels of vitamin C, which is a co-factor in the production of dopamine, the “zest for life” neurotransmitter. And the antioxidants reduce inflammation, which may lead to higher levels of eudaemonic well-being. Aristotle\'s notion of eudaemonia, described as the highest of all human goods, the realization of one\'s true potential, which was the aim of this study. They wanted to know whether eating fruit and vegetables was associated with other markers of well-being beyond happiness and life satisfaction, like greater eudaemonic well-being – a state of flourishing characterized by feelings of engagement, meaning, and purpose in life. So a sample of about 400 young adults were followed for about two weeks and indeed young adults who ate more fruit and veggies reported higher average eudaemonic well-being, more intense feelings of curiosity, and greater creativity. And they could follow this on a day by day basis— greater well-being on the days they ate healthier. These findings suggest that  fruit and vegetable intake is related to other aspects of human flourishing, beyond just feeling happy. Not so fast, though. Instead of eating good food leading to a good mood, maybe the good mood led to eating good food. Experimentally, if you put people in a good mood, they rate healthy foods like apples higher than indulgent foods like candy bars. Given a choice between M&M’s and grapes, individuals in a positive mood were more likely to choose the grapes. The results of these studies lend support to a growing body of research that suggests that positive mood facilitates resistance to temptation. Who needs comfort food when you’re already comforted? It’s like which came first, the chicken or the egg? Yes, eating eggs can increase our likelihood of chronic disease, but maybe chronic disease also increases our likelihood of eating unhealthy foods. Which came first, the mood or the food? What we need is a study like this, but instead of looking at well-being and diet on the same day, you see if there’s a correlation between what you eat today, and how you feel tomorrow. But we didn’t have a study like that… until now. They found the same strong relationships between daily positive mood and fruit and vegetable consumption, but lagged analyses showed that fruit and vegetable consumption predicted improvements in positive mood the next day, not vice versa. On days when people ate more fruits and vegetables, they reported feeling calmer, happier, and more energetic than they normally do, and they also felt more positive the next day. So, eating fruit and vegetables really may promote emotional well-being. Look, single bouts of exercise can elevate one’s mood, why not the same thing with healthy food? How many fruits and vegetables? Seems we need to consume approximately 7.2 daily servings of fruit or 8.2 servings of vegetables to notice a meaningful change.')]","For boosting energy and improving mental clarity while feeling sluggish at work, incorporating certain snacks that are rich in nutrients can be beneficial. Based on Dr. Michael Greger's research and discussions, here are some snack ideas that could help:

1. **Nuts**: Nuts like walnuts are shown to improve cognitive performance and critical thinking. They are also a good source of healthy fats, protein, and fiber, which can help sustain energy levels throughout the day.

2. **Berries**: Berries, such as blueberries and strawberries, are high in antioxidants and have been linked to improvements in cognitive functions and mental clarity. They can also influence mood positively due to their natural sugars and fiber, providing a steady energy release.

3. **Spinach**: Incorporating spinach into a snack, perhaps as part of a smoothie or salad, can be beneficial. Spinach has been shown to alleviate markers of oxidative stress and muscle damage, which might help in maintaining energy and clarity during physically or mentally demanding tasks.

4. **Fruits**: Apples, bananas, and oranges not only provide quick, natural sugars for an energy boost but also contain fiber and vitamins that support sustained energy release and mental alertness.

5. **Raisins**: As a dried fruit, raisins can be a good source of concentrated energy and have been shown to perform equally to commercial sports gels in sustaining energy, making them a handy and healthy snack for a quick energy boost.

6. **Dark Chocolate**: Moderate amounts of dark chocolate, rich in cocoa solids, can improve mood and alertness. It contains flavonoids that boost brain health, though it's important to choose varieties with a high percentage of cocoa and low amounts of sugar.

7. **Vegetable sticks with hummus**: The combination of raw vegetables (like carrots, bell peppers, and cucumbers) with hummus (which contains chickpeas, olive oil, and lemon) provides a mix of carbohydrates, protein, and healthy fats, ideal for sustained energy and cognitive function.

These snacks not only help in boosting energy and mental clarity but also contribute to overall health, aligning with Dr. Greger's advocacy for plant-based, nutrient-rich foods.","For boosting energy and improving mental clarity while feeling sluggish at work, incorporating certain snacks that are rich in nutrients can be beneficial.

You hear a lot of that larger-than-life talk about amla coming out of Indian medical journals. Who can forget “Amla, a wonder berry in the treatment and prevention of cancer.” Amla is so revered that you find serious scientists, at serious academic institutions, in serious peer-reviewed medical journals, making statements like this: “Every part of the Indian gooseberry plant has its unique therapeutic characteristic for the remedy of almost all the ailments and can be adopted as a single bullet against disease.” OK, then. I first ran across it in this famous article, looking at the total antioxidant content of thousands of different foods. I did a series of videos about it ages ago. And, to my surprise, the #1 most antioxidant packed single whole food on the planet, on average, was amla: dried powdered Indian gooseberries, beating out the prior heavyweight champion, cloves, with, just for comparison’s sake, up to a hundred times or more antioxidants by weight than blueberries. So, here’s this fruit that has enjoyed “a hallowed position in Ayurveda,” the ancient system of medicine in India - so hallowed it was mythologically pegged as the first tree in the universe. So, for thousands of years—before we even knew what an antioxidant was, they were revering this plant that just so happens to turn out to be the most antioxidant packed fruit on the Planet Earth. OK, you got my attention. But, I still needed to see it put to the test. Well, indigenous tribal healers used amla to treat diabetes. So, researchers decided to give it a try. This is the study that originally bowled me over. In fact, it was the subject of one of my first NutritionFacts videos of all time over 5 years ago: the effect of amla fruit on the blood sugars and cholesterol levels of normal subjects and type 2 diabetic patients. In my video, I talked about the jaw-dropping effects of five cents worth of this powdered fruit, five pennies worth, compared to a diabetes drug. But, what about the cholesterol effects? If you take healthy individuals and give them a placebo sugar pill, nothing much happens to their cholesterol. Ideally, we want our total cholesterol under 150. This was a pretty healthy group, the average cholesterol in the U.S. is over 200, which is where the diabetics started out in this study. And, when you give them placebo pills, nothing much happens either. But, give people just about a half teaspoon of amla powder a day— not some extract or something, just dried Indian gooseberries, a powdered fruit and this is what happens. That’s like a 35-40% drop in three weeks— absolutely astounding. That’s the kind of thing we see like 6 months after putting people on statin drugs. What we care about most is LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol, shooting for under at least 70 ideally. No impact of the placebos, but again, just about a half teaspoon of amla, which would cost you about 5 cents a day, so like a buck fifty a month, and boom. These results knocked my socks off. I mean, they’re just un-believable. That’s why I was so excited after all these years to dig back into the amla literature to see if these findings had been confirmed or replicated elsewhere. So, I typed amla into PubMed and waded through all the papers on using amla to decrease methane in cow farts, and speed the growth of chickens, or hey, what about amla ice cream? After all, amla is packed with fiber and phytonutrients. In contrast, ice cream is not.

You hear a lot of that larger-than-life talk about amla coming out of Indian medical journals. Who can forget “Amla, a wonder berry in the treatment and prevention of cancer.” Amla is so revered that you find serious scientists, at serious academic institutions, in serious peer-reviewed medical journals, making statements like this: “Every part of the Indian gooseberry plant has its unique therapeutic characteristic for the remedy of almost all the ailments and can be adopted as a single bullet against disease.” OK, then. I first ran across it in this famous article, looking at the total antioxidant content of thousands of different foods. I did a series of videos about it ages ago. And, to my surprise, the #1 most antioxidant packed single whole food on the planet, on average, was amla: dried powdered Indian gooseberries, beating out the prior heavyweight champion, cloves, with, just for comparison’s sake, up to a hundred times or more antioxidants by weight than blueberries. So, here’s this fruit that has enjoyed “a hallowed position in Ayurveda,” the ancient system of medicine in India - so hallowed it was mythologically pegged as the first tree in the universe. So, for thousands of years—before we even knew what an antioxidant was, they were revering this plant that just so happens to turn out to be the most antioxidant packed fruit on the Planet Earth. OK, you got my attention. But, I still needed to see it put to the test. Well, indigenous tribal healers used amla to treat diabetes. So, researchers decided to give it a try. This is the study that originally bowled me over. In fact, it was the subject of one of my first NutritionFacts videos of all time over 5 years ago: the effect of amla fruit on the blood sugars and cholesterol levels of normal subjects and type 2 diabetic patients. In my video, I talked about the jaw-dropping effects of five cents worth of this powdered fruit, five pennies worth, compared to a diabetes drug. But, what about the cholesterol effects? If you take healthy individuals and give them a placebo sugar pill, nothing much happens to their cholesterol. Ideally, we want our total cholesterol under 150. This was a pretty healthy group, the average cholesterol in the U.S. is over 200, which is where the diabetics started out in this study. And, when you give them placebo pills, nothing much happens either. But, give people just about a half teaspoon of amla powder a day— not some extract or something, just dried Indian gooseberries, a powdered fruit and this is what happens. That’s like a 35-40% drop in three weeks— absolutely astounding. That’s the kind of thing we see like 6 months after putting people on statin drugs. What we care about most is LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol, shooting for under at least 70 ideally. No impact of the placebos, but again, just about a half teaspoon of amla, which would cost you about 5 cents a day, so like a buck fifty a month, and boom. These results knocked my socks off. I mean, they’re just un-believable. That’s why I was so excited after all these years to dig back into the amla literature to see if these findings had been confirmed or replicated elsewhere. So, I typed amla into PubMed and waded through all the papers on using amla to decrease methane in cow farts, and speed the growth of chickens, or hey, what about amla ice cream? After all, amla is packed with fiber and phytonutrients. In contrast, ice cream is not. Therefore… And indeed, amla incorporated into ice cream increases the antioxidant capacity. though I would not recommend it for cholesterol lowering. Ah, but here we go.

here especially on YouTube where we just reached a hundred million views on YouTube so excited to I think it was just last week we broke that and if you didn't know that well obviously didn't get our

selling anything just put up as a public service as a labor of love as a tribute to my grandmother whose own life was saved with evidence-based nutrition I can see there's a whole long list of questions already in here I'm going to just start at the top and go down the list and hopefully get to everybody if not I'm sorry if you missed my Facebook live Q&A session earlier today but every month I'm back to a monthly schedule you signed up a newsletter and you and I will tell you when my next Q&A is on both YouTube and Facebook are for next month alright first question on Melissa Joe whereas what are the best source so one of the best practices in terms of ensuring the safety of dishes Oh regarding a detergent contamination of food and drink so yeah for anyone who saw my video I did a video talking about this very surfactants um added as as food additives but also found in detergents which help get dirty dishes clean but unfortunately if you don't wash them off then can actually kind of make your gut leaky and lead to problems and so the so but this was an issue this is not like oh what am I gonna do with my dishwasher to get every last trace off water it just gets rid of it so what they were with the problem that these researchers were citing were people that wash like don't rinse their dishes period like literally they like uh you know they take a sponge with detergent on it and then you know I don't know wipe off all the food and then just putting in a drying rack like literally don't want rinse at all with water and then you're leaving a coat of detergent which wouldn't be good to then eat um but as soon as dishes get squeaky that's getting all the detergent off you know how if it's all slippery when you got dish soap on it because I'll suddenly get squeaky where it's not slippery anymore I'm whether you do it washing yourself in Washington the in the dishwasher well then the detergent is gone and so you have to worry about it so so basically the answer your question is just rinse um and this washes do that for you Jessica went Lennon Lamine ass thank you you're welcome do you know if decaffeinated green tea is as healthy as regular we'd like to avoid caffeine well decaf green tea is definitely better than no green tea unfortunately the decaffeination process cannot just remove caffeine and removes the compounds with a similar molecular weight to caffeine and so you actually do lose some of the phytonutrients so so green tea would presumably be healthier than decaf green tea but if for whatever reason you want to do decaf like it in the night you know drinking caffeinated green tea can interfere with their sleep and so that would be a perfect time where decaf would come in or for whatever reason you want to caffeine absolutely decaf is I still want decaf green tea is one of the healthiest possible beverages if you don't care about the caffeine or if you want the caffeine decaf it's not as good as regular but definitely SuperDuper healthy um sir Sergio Garcia asks um I want to know if you think white potatoes safe to eat Oh saw something about the glencoe like glyco alkaloids um so when you ask is X safe or is X good for you oh yeah any food the question really is compared to what right so our eggs good for you well compared to the breakfast sauces that might be next to it yes compared to oatmeal not even close right is fish good for you well compared to what again is it compared to a hot tub um then yes is it compared to chickpeas well then no and so so same thing with white potatoes our weight potatoes good for you baby well we gonna have instead of white potatoes you're gonna have a sweet potato then yes they're bad compared to sweet potatoes sweet potatoes are healthier than white potatoes right but our white potatoes better than you know a bologna sandwich absolutely right and so and so I was just in that video trying to you know basically there's a hierarchy there's some foods that are healthier than others um so yes we should just focus I mean the big thing is focused on centering our diets or on whole plant foods period let's just start there okay and then once you do that then okay as the next level you can be like oh okay well are some foods better than others okay iceberg lettuce whole plant food um is it bad for you no but is it bad for you compared to romaine lettuce or compared to arugula well yes comparatively so but doesn't mean iceberg lettuce is bad and is better than a lot of than eating a Twinkie you know um so anyway so so on the spectrum of healthiness of fruits and vegetables white potatoes are more kind of the iceberg lettuce to the vegetable kingdom that doesn't mean too bad for you it just means there are healthier choices that have kind of similar mouthfeel so instead of you know baked white potatoes you could have big sweeps toes instead of white potato fries you have super said fries or in my household purple sweet potato fighters one of my favorite foods um and I'm known for my palate they seem better and so they're healthier end I'm not even better for you then so anyway that's just but again it's not something you know the important thing more whole plant foods the better and then if you want to go next level graduate level then you can talk about oh well maybe some whole plant foods are even better than the nominal plant foods you know purple cabbage better than green cabbage etc etc okay Leanne a ask twice creeped out the no beans is it bad to blend in eat the outer vanilla bean shell not that I know of um when I blend smoothies with vanilla beans I throw in the whole thing maybe we're both doing it wrong but as far as I know it's fine I'm I think the reason they do that is because for for you know they're not blending in most recipes that are using vanilla beans so you know the the shell wouldn't wouldn't break down but a you know if you're blending my that's just more vanilla flavor as far as I'm concerned Lee and then has another question when blending lemons is that okay keep the seeds in absolutely in fact that's one of the reasons I encourage people to blend rather than just use lemon juice but again you know as I say in the cookbooks it's such a small silly it was really just like I wanted everything to be green like food everything to be the whole plant food and so lemon juice is technically not a whole plant food right cuz the fiber removed it's just juice right but we're talking about like a teaspoon of juice it doesn't really matter but I was like you know just I mean it just there's more kind of like I just want every you know ingredient to the old plant food and look there are a lot of nutrients actually in the brine to the peel the zest the scenes so why not um anyway so yeah but yeah seeds that's that's one of the healthiest parts David woods food or beverages good for feminine health that's a big question well um I think I know what I mean so feminine number one killer of women you want feminine heart disease and so plant-based I only died ever been proven to a reverse number-one killer of women I mean the majority of patients but but if you're talking about like painful periods or menopausal issues then there are specific foods that may help so there are in terms of dietary patterns there have been I have featured studies on the website and if you some facts that or talking about you know putting people with the painful periods for example on the plant-based diet seeing significant improvement try some specific foods there's flax seeds soy foods just type in whatever feminine health issue you are concerned about ovarian cancer breast cancer etc and all the foods and dietary patterns should pop up on the website and if you have a specific question I'd be happy to answer it here just add it and just be a little more specific eat Lundy says LDL cholesterol up several points on a whole food plant-based diet could hemp or flax seeds be the cows no those who should not to raise your cholesterol typically so I mean the only really plant-based sources saturated fat or a tropical oils so coconut oil palm kernel oil palm oil but I mean so I I'm being curious that what your LDL is I mean I'm still in a safe or region if your basically our heart attack proof level doesn't matter whether it's you know you know 50 or 57 you basically just don't have enough substrate in your arteries and your blistering to build up in your ordering ball and see you're safe and sound if however it's higher then you may want to start adding foods to your diet that I actively pull cholesterol from your body like the soluble fiber rich foods like slimy food is okra oatmeal ain't bland the whole portfolio diet kind of thing that's the David

Drugs are effective, but  produce adverse side effects in a significant proportion of patients. Statins, such as Lipitor, are  the most widely prescribed, but they produce adverse effects  in up to a third of patients. Adverse effects are also associated  with the other drugs in common usage. “Adverse effects may include liver,  muscle, and kidney dysfunctions; skin disorders; abdominal pain;  nausea; constipation; dizziness; flushing; neurological disorders;  and cognitive impairment. On the other hand,  therapies based on dietary and lifestyle changes produce  little or no adverse effects [in fact, tend to have  positive side effects] and are the cornerstone of recommendations by the [official U.S. body]… American Heart Association… [as well as the  international guidelines]. Recommendations include reduced  intake of saturated fat and cholesterol while increasing physical activity  and intake of dietary fiber.” So, we need to eat fewer animal foods,  the only source of cholesterol, and more plants, the only source of fiber.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Chicken, fish, and egg powder in processed foods present greater risk from cholesterol oxidation byproducts, but there are things you can do to reduce exposure.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

But that\'s not all. Cholesterol oxidation products are associated with the initiation and progression of multiple major chronic diseases, including heart disease,  diabetes, and kidney failure. And they\'re produced when animal products are heated. All forms of cooking can do it, since you can get maximum cholesterol oxidation at only about 300 degrees Fahrenheit. But is there some type of cooking that\'s worse than others? Well, if you look at foal meat, which is like baby horse meat, higher levels of oxidation in general were found in microwaved meat. And indeed, microwaving chicken or beef appears to produce about twice as much cholesterol oxidation than frying. Whereas if you look at bacon, raw bacon wasn\'t found to have any oxidized cholesterol. It has cholesterol, like all animal products, but it\'s not oxidized until you cook it. Grilling seems to be the safest the first time around, but then when you put it back in the fridge and reheat it later using the same method, they all shoot up. It\'s not just heat, though. Although levels in raw meats are usually low, concentrations tend to increase dramatically after exposure to pro-oxidation agents such as light. What are you supposed to do, crawl inside the pig and eat the bacon from the inside? No. You could wrap the meat in red plastic wrap. Clear plastic wrap doesn\'t seem to work, but the red blocks some of the light waves and can delay cholesterol oxidation. This was for horse meat slices. The problem is worse with sliced meat products because more of the meat is exposed to air and light. Same problem with ground meat; it\'s just so much more exposed. Unless you keep meat in some kind of vacuum pack, even in a dark refrigerator the oxygen exposure alone can shoot up oxidation levels. Or in the freezer. Yeah, cooking raw fish can boost levels from 8 to 18, but after a few months frozen fish—even raw— starts out about ten times higher and just goes up from there. And in terms of which meat is the worst, microwaved or fried, chicken was twice as bad as beef. The reason, it seems, has to do with the polyunsaturated fat content of the muscle, which goes fish, then poultry, then pork, then beef, then lamb. So white meat is more susceptible to cholesterol oxidation. Yes, red meat has more saturated fat, but fish and chicken tend to build up more oxidized cholesterol. So, chicken and roasted salmon have been shown to generate greater amounts of cholesterol oxidation products than other types of meat. Surprisingly though, the highest increase of oxidized cholesterol in salmon was found through steaming, mainly just because it\'s exposed to heat longer. Cholesterol oxidation increased after each cooking procedure, but steaming increased the total amount by more than 1000%. There are two ways chicken meat may pull ahead, though. One is if you feed the chickens rancid fat in the first place. And unfortunately, all sorts of substandard stuff ends up at the rendering plant to be turned into animal feed. And also irradiation. When chicken meat is irradiated to improve food safety from an infectious disease standpoint, it may diminish food safety from a chronic disease standpoint. But, hey, it\'s better than dying from salmonella. In terms of dairy, in my last video I talked about the potential dangers of ghee, which made me wonder about UHT milk, which stands for ultra-high temperature processing, to make those little half-and-half no-refrigeration-needed coffee creamers. That does seem to boost oxidized cholesterol levels by about 50%, worse than just regular pasteurization, though interestingly if you can find goat milk half-and-half, that would be safer. Same problem with eggs. Egg powder in processed foods is good for shelf life but may not be so good for human life. So that\'s like packaged food with eggs in it, like pasta, many baked goods, mayonnaise. So even people who stay away from egg eggs may still be unwittingly exposed through processed foods if they don\'t read the label. If it\'s all about oxidation, why not just add synthetic or natural antioxidants to the animal products themselves? They\'ve certainly tried, like what about adding lemon balm tea to hamburger patties? It didn\'t work, but that\'s likely because they couldn\'t add enough without affecting the taste. What about adding cherries? They\'re red, would blend right in. And it worked! Two different types of tart cherries significantly reduced the cholesterol oxidation, but meat with a cherry on top seems a little out of place. How about just good old garlic and onions? Here\'s the amount of oxidized cholesterol in a plain pork chop, significantly reduced by adding onion and garlic, though interestingly in chicken cholesterol oxidation was helped by sage, but not garlic. In fact, garlic may even accelerate fat oxidation. So, there are several measures that can be taken to reduce cholesterol oxidation in foods: reducing the total cholesterol content in food by not cooking food with cholesterol-containing fat like butter or lard; maybe we can feed animals antioxidants before or add them afterwards; use as-low-a-temperature to cook as possible; use some kind of opaque vacuum packing or something. But if you take a step back, only foods that start out with cholesterol can end up with oxidized cholesterol. So, the primary method, in terms of reducing cholesterol oxidation in foods, may be to reduce the total cholesterol content of the food, not just by avoiding adding extra with butter, but instead centering one\'s diet around whole plant foods, which don\'t have any cholesterol to get oxidized in the first place.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'What are the effects of oatmeal, walnuts, extra virgin olive oil, and avocados on LDL cholesterol size?\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

So, no wonder cholesterol goes down. So, for example, if you take people eating a standard North American diet, including animal fats — dairy and poultry are the  two greatest contributors of cholesterol-raising saturated fat intake- they may start out with an LDL up around here. Just add avocado to their diet without doing anything else and cholesterol does not go down, but add avocado while reducing saturated fat intake, and cholesterol falls, but no more than just  reducing saturated fat while adding nothing. OK, but what if you eat no meat at all, versus no meat with avocado added? They took people with  sky-high cholesterol up around 300 and switched them to a relatively low-fat vegetarian diet with about 20% of calories from fat versus a vegetarian diet  with added avocado, bringing it up to a more  typical fat content, 30% of calories from fat. This group started out with LDLs through the roof and while cutting out meat  may have helped, cutting out meat and adding avocado seemed to help even more. And, it may help best with  the worst type of LDL. As I’ve touched on before, all LDL cholesterol is bad cholesterol, but large, fluffy LDL may only increase the odds of cardiac events, like heart attacks, 31%, whereas small, dense LDL is even worse. Feed people lots of oatmeal and oat bran, and not only does their LDL  go down overall, but it specifically brings down the worst of the worst. Add walnuts to a low-fat diet, and not only does LDL go down, but the size distribution of the LDL shifts to a little more benign as well. And, if you put people on  a plant-based diet with lots of fiber and nuts, you can get a massive 30% drop in LDL, comparable to a cholesterol- lowering statin drug. And, this includes the small, dense most dangerous LDL. Note, this does not happen with extra-virgin olive oil. So, it’s not just a  monounsaturated fat effect. In the famous PREDIMED study, those randomized to the extra nuts group got a significant drop in the smallest, densest LDL, but those randomized to the extra virgin olive oil group did not. So, there appears to be some special components in nuts that lowers the worst of the worst. Do avocados offer similar benefits? We didn\'t know… until, now. In the first randomized  controlled feeding trial to look at avocados and LDL size, what they did was remove animal fat from people’s diet and replaced it with either carbs, or avocados, or vegetable oils that had a similar fat profile to the avocados. So, the two latter diets were very similar diets, but one had the nutrients unique to the avocados and the other didn\'t. What happened? Well, any time you drop saturated fat, you’re going to bring down LDL, whether you replace animal fat with plant fat, oil in this case, or with carbs. But, what if you replace animal fat with the whole plant food avocado— an even better effect. And, to see why, they broke the LDL down into large versus small. They all brought the dangerous large LDL down, but the avocado had the additional effect of also bringing down the super dangerous small LDL. That’s where that extra drop came from. So, it’s not just a matter of replacing animal fat with plant fat; there are additional benefits to the fiber and phytonutrients of whole plant foods like avocados. Oh, there’s something good in avocados? Well then, let’s just add avocado extracts to the meat. Incorporating avocado extracts into pork patties evidently reduces cholesterol  oxidation products, well documented to be toxic, carcinogenic, and atherosclerotic, but less so, apparently, with some avocado mixed in.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Which foods are best at removing carcinogenic bile acids from the body: asparagus, beets, broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, collards, eggplant, green beans, kale, mustard greens, okra, or peppers?

To lower the risk of diet and lifestyle-related premature  degenerative diseases and to advance human nutrition research, relative bile acid–binding potential  of foods needs to be evaluated. Since the bile acids are absorbed back into  the system they may increase cancer risk. Some vegetables bind bile acids better than others. We know that those eating plant-based diets are  at lower risk of heart disease and cancer, which could in part be because of phytonutrients  in plants that act as antioxidants and potent stimulators of natural  detoxifying enzymes in our bodies. They can also lower cholesterol  and detoxify harmful metabolites, functions that can be predicted by their ability to  bind bile acids so as to remove them from our body. This group of researchers discovered  three important things. First, an over five-fold variability in bile acid binding  among various vegetables that had similar fiber content, indicating that the bile acid binding is not necessarily  related to the total dietary fiber content, but instead to some combination of unique  phytonutrients yet to be determined. Second, they found that steaming significantly  improves the bile acid binding of collards, kale, mustard greens,  broccoli, peppers, and cabbage, as well as beets, eggplant, asparagus,  carrots, green beans, and cauliflower, suggesting steaming vegetables may be  more healthful than those consumed raw. And finally, they determined which vegetables  kicked the most bile binding butt? Turnips turn-up last. Then comes cabbage, cauliflower, bell peppers,  spinach, asparagus and green beans, beaten out by mustard greens and broccoli.

Here’s prunes, dried mangoes (which I love,  so I was happy about that), dried apricots, dried cherries (through the roof), with goji berries at the top. They also analyzed dried apple. Where do you think it fit? I would have guessed towards the bottom— maybe even lower than raisins— but, I would have been wrong. Dried apple rings landed way up here, making them one of the healthiest  dried fruits on the planet. In fact, a preliminary  report was released at a recent nutrition conference, suggesting that daily  dried apple consumption promotes cardiovascular health  in postmenopausal women. Split the women into two groups, and those forced to eat 3 ounces  of dried apple rings a day for a year saw their bad cholesterol  drop 23%— that’s huge! LDL dropped 23%!

What role might our diet play? Increased fruit and  vegetable consumption has been reported to reduce the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, heart attacks, and strokes. Well, maybe it’s in part because of all the antioxidants in healthy plant foods preventing the oxidation  of LDL cholesterol. And, indeed, the LDL oxidation resistance was found to be greatest among those eating more plant-based. So, that would be in addition to the decreased blood pressure  and lower LDL overall in terms of beneficial effects. But, you don’t know if it’s cause-and-effect... until you put it to the test. Put people on a whole food plant-based diet for just 3 weeks, and rates and extent of LDL oxidation drop. The effects of kale on LDL oxidation were put to the test. Kale is a best-of-all-worlds food, low in calories and packed to the hilt with nutrition—vitamins, minerals, anti-inflammatory compounds, antioxidant phytonutrients, you name it. No surprise, then, given its high antioxidant capacity, kale showed a protective effect on the oxidation of LDL even at low concentrations. But, this was in vitro, in a test tube. Kale was also put to the test in mice, but what about people? I did a video on this study, on how kale juice improves coronary artery disease risk factors in men with high cholesterol. Extraordinary results, a 20% drop in LDL among the nonsmokers; but they were drinking the equivalent of about 10 cups of kale a day. Still, the fact that they were able to see such an improvement, even though nearly all the fiber was removed, because it was just juice, shows there does seem to be something special in the plant. But, can you get the benefit just eating the stuff? Let’s find out. The effect of black and red cabbage on oxidized LDL, and by black cabbage, they mean lacinato kale, also known as dinosaur or Tuscan kale. They had people eat a bag of frozen kale and cabbage a day for just 2 weeks, which is great because you just keep it in the freezer, prewashed, pre-chopped— just throw it in any meal you are making— and got significant reductions of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and even blood sugar levels, and the antioxidant capacity of their blood went up; so, no surprise they demonstrated a significant decrease in oxidized LDL too. Would it have been better to take that red cabbage and ferment it into sauerkraut? Red or purple cabbage is one of my favorite vegetables, packed with antioxidants, yet dirt cheap and seems to last forever in the fridge, and it’s pretty, and juicy, and tasty— I try to slice shreds off into any meal I’m making. But, when you ferment it, not only do you add way too much salt, but you end up wiping out some of the nutrition. Here’s the big spike in  antioxidant capacity of your bloodstream in the hours after eating fresh red cabbage, cut down by almost 30% if you ate the same amount in fermented form. Does cabbage have to be raw though? No, some cooking  techniques may improve the antioxidant activity in kale and red cabbage. The effects of the cooking process can be positive, since cooking softens the vegetable tissues, helping your body extract the active compounds. However, cooking can also be negative, because heat treatment can degrade some of the compounds. They looked at a variety of different cooking methods and concluded steaming may be considered to be the best home cooking technique to prepare kale and red cabbage. But with foods that healthy, the truly best way to prepare them is whatever way will get you to eat the most of them.')]","To manage cholesterol and support good digestion, incorporating a variety of whole plant foods that are rich in fiber and phytonutrients is beneficial. Here are some food options that can help achieve these goals:

1. **Oats and Barley**: These grains are high in soluble fiber, which can help lower LDL cholesterol (the ""bad"" cholesterol) and support digestive health. Soluble fiber dissolves in water to form a gel-like substance, helping to reduce cholesterol absorption in your bloodstream.

2. **Legumes**: Beans, lentils, and peas are excellent sources of soluble fiber, which not only helps manage cholesterol levels but also promotes regular bowel movements and a healthy gut microbiome.

3. **Nuts and Seeds**: Particularly almonds, walnuts, flaxseeds, and chia seeds, which contain healthy fats and fibers that help in lowering LDL cholesterol and enhancing digestive health.

4. **Fruits and Vegetables**: Rich in various types of fibers, antioxidants, and phytonutrients, fruits and vegetables like apples, berries, okra, and eggplant can help reduce cholesterol and support digestive health. The fiber content helps bulk up stool and promotes regularity.

5. **Avocados**: High in monounsaturated fats and fiber, avocados can help lower LDL cholesterol and maintain healthy digestion.

6. **Whole Plant Foods Rich in Antioxidants**: Foods like kale, cabbage, and beets not only support cholesterol management but also provide fibers that aid digestion. Steaming these vegetables can enhance their bile acid-binding ability, which is beneficial for both cholesterol management and digestive health.

7. **Fermented Foods**: While they might not directly lower cholesterol, foods like sauerkraut and kimchi are excellent for digestive health due to their probiotic content, which helps maintain a healthy gut flora.

Including these foods in a balanced, plant-based diet can help manage cholesterol levels effectively while also supporting a healthy digestive system. Remember to drink plenty of water, as hydration plays a crucial role in digestion and overall health.","To manage cholesterol and support good digestion, incorporating a variety of whole plant foods that are rich in fiber and phytonutrients is beneficial.

And if you want more, just go to NutritionFacts.Org/Topics/Microbiome for all my videos on good gut health. ""How to Cultivate a Healthy Gut Microbiome with Food"" When we eat meat, dairy, eggs, seafood, our gut flora can take certain components in them (carnitine and choline) and produce something that ends up as a toxic compound called TMAO, which may set us up for a heart attack, stroke, and death. So, give people two eggs, and you get a spike of TMAO in your bloodstream within hours of consumption. Because gut bacteria play a critical role in this process, though, if you then give them a week of antibiotics to wipe out their gut flora and refeed them two more eggs, nothing happens. No TMAO in their bloodstream because they have no egg-eating bacteria to make it. But give it a month for their gut bacteria to start to grow back, and the eggs start to cause TMAO production once again. The same thing with meat. Give people the equivalent of an 11-ounce steak, and TMAO levels shoot up in the blood. But feed them the same amount after a week of antibiotics and nothing happens. So to run into problems, you need both the meat and the meat-eating bugs. That\'s why you can feed a vegan a sirloin, and they don\'t produce TMAO within their body. They just don\'t have the meat-eating bugs in their gut. Okay, now this should all be old news for those who\'ve been following the science. The reason for this video is to show that this phenomenon happens the other way around, too. When we eat whole plant foods, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans, along with nuts and seeds, our gut flora can take certain components in them (fiber and resistant starch) and produce short-chain fatty acids which can set us up for the prevention of human diseases. Short-chain fatty acids like butyrate can help seal up a leaky gut, fight inflammation, prevent weight gain, improve insulin sensitivity, accelerate weight loss, and fight cancer. But these benefits rely on two things: eating fiber and having fiber-feeding bugs, just like the detrimental effects from TMAO required not only eggs, dairy, or meat, but also the eggs, dairy, or meat-munching bugs. Check this out. If you give people whole intact grains — in this case barley kernels, also known as barley groats — three servings a day, like I recommend in my Daily Dozen app, within just three days of eating that extra 30+ grams of fiber and resistant starch, their gut bugs were so happy and produced so many short-chain fatty acids that people\'s insulin levels improved by 25%, which means their bodies needed to produce less insulin to take care of the same amount of white bread, while still dampening the blood sugar spike. But this was on average. Some people responded to all that extra fiber with beautiful dips in blood sugar and insulin responses, but in others, the same amount of fiber and resistant starch didn\'t work at all. Why? Because you don\'t just need fiber, but fiber-feeding bugs like Prevotella. How do you get more Prevotella so you can take full advantage of the health benefits of plants? Eat more plants. Prevotella abundance is associated with long-term fiber intake. If you look at rural African children eating 97% whole food, plant-based diets, their Prevotella is off the charts compared to kids eating standard Western diets, and this is reflected in the amount of short-chain fatty acids they are churning out in their poop. In the industrialized world, it\'s those habitually eating vegetarian and vegan that promotes the enrichment of fiber-eating bacteria in the gut. Here\'s the relative Prevotella abundance between those who eat meat, no meat, or all plants. This may help explain the worse inflammatory profile in omnivores than in vegetarians. Based on the findings relative to bacteria abundance, the researchers suggest that exposure to animal foods may favor an intestinal environment which could trigger systemic inflammation and insulin resistance-dependent metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes. And it\'s the reduced levels of inflammation that may be the key factor linking a plant-based gut microbiota with protective health benefits. Yeah, but can\'t meat-eaters eat lots of plants, too? Omnivores have constraints on diet-dependent gut microbiome metabolite production. In other words, it\'s the flip side of the vegan eating a steak. They can eat all the fiber they want but may be lacking in fiber-munching machinery. At low levels of fiber intake, the more you eat, the more of the beneficial short-chain fatty acids are made. But at a certain point, your available fiber-feeders are maxed out, and there\'s only so much you can benefit. But those habitually eating a plant-based diet have been cultivating the growth of these fiber-feeders, and the sky\'s the limit, unless, of course, you\'re eating vegan junk. But a whole food, plant-based diet should be effective in promoting a diverse ecosystem of beneficial bacteria to support both our gut microbiome and our overall health.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'We co-evolved a symbiosis with our good gut bacteria, but we aren’t holding up our end of the bargain.

Learning about fruit, vegetables, and cancer prevention was a hallmark. But hitting the top 5, cited more than 2,000 times, “Dietary modulation of the human microbiom introducing the concept of prebiotics.” Prebiotics are the food components that feed and nourish the good bacteria in our gut, like fiber and resistant starch. In general, eating high-fiber plant foods is a good foundation for a prebiotic-rich diet. Once upon a time, fiber was just thought of as just the undigested component of foods, known only for bulking up stools and keeping our bowels regular. Then, we discovered an array of receptors in the body in which fiber breakdown products fit in like a lock-and-key. We feed our good bacteria with fiber, and they feed us right back, munching the fiber and creating short chain fatty acids that get absorbed into our bloodstream and fit into these receptors that are expressed on immune cells and generally mediate a direct anti-inﬂammatory effect. So, the reason for lower systemic inﬂammation in plant-based eaters may not just be due to the abundance of anti-inﬂammatory molecules in plant foods or the avoidance of proinﬂammatory molecules in animal foods, but from the production of anti-inflammatory molecules from scratch by our good gut bugs when we feed them fiber. Just to give you an idea how protective fiber-rich foods can be, those randomized to get advice to eat fiber-rich plant foods during radiation therapy for cancer didn’t just experience reduced toxicity during the treatments, but even a full year later. Indeed, the benefits of fiber are supported by more than a century of research. Prospective studies show striking reductions in death from all causes put together, including “total cancer deaths, total cardiovascular disease deaths and incidence, stroke incidence, and incidence of colorectal, breast, and esophageal cancer.” And “dose-response relationships” suggest that the more the better, in terms of protecting against heart attacks and stroke, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. So, at a minimum, fiber intakes should be no less than 25–29 grams per day,with additional benefits likely to accrue with higher intakes. Yet, the average American only consumes about 16 grams of ﬁber per day. We have coevolved over millennia with gut bacteria to the point of reliance on our good gut bugs, a kind of symbiosis for ﬁber digestion and the production of short chain fatty acids, and even certain vitamins. Yet, we’re not holding up our end of the bargain. We’re supposed to be providing up to 100 or so grams of fiber a day, and we are barely passing along a measly 16 grams. The simplest solution, the simplest approach to remedy this lack of dietary fiber is to encourage consumption of whole food plant-based nutrition.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Inadequate consumption of prebiotics—the fiber and resistant starch concentrated in unprocessed plant foods—can cause a disease-promoting imbalance in our gut microbiome.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

In other words, primarily fiber. One reason we can get an increase of nearly two grams of stool for every one gram of fiber is that the fiber fermentation process in our colon promotes bacterial growth. The bulk of our stool by weight is pure bacteria, trillions and trillions of bacteria, and that was on a whimpy, fiber-deficient British diet. People who take fiber supplements know this— a few spoonfuls of fiber can lead to a massive bowel movement, because fiber is what our good gut bacteria thrive on. When we eat a whole plant food like fruit, we’re telling our gut flora to be fruitful, and multiply. And from fiber, our gut flora produce short-chain fatty acids, which are an important energy source for the cells lining our colon. So, we feed our flora with fiber, and then they turn around and feed us right back. These short chain fatty acids also function to suppress inflammation and cancer. That’s why eating fiber may be so good for us. But when we don’t eat enough whole plant foods, we are in effect starving our microbial self. On traditional plant-based diets, like Dr. Burkitt described: lots of fiber, lots of short chain fatty acids, and lots of protection from Western diseases like colon cancer. Whereas on a standard American diet, where we’re eating highly processed food, there’s nothing left over for our gut flora. It\'s all absorbed in  the small intestine before it ever makes it down to the colon. Not only may this mean loss of beneficial microbial metabolites, but also a loss in beneficial microbes themselves. The biggest issue presented by a Western diet is that not leaving anything for our bacteria to eat results in dysbiosis, an imbalance where bad bacteria can take over and increase our susceptibility to inflammatory diseases or colon cancer, or maybe even metabolic syndrome  or type 2 diabetes, or cardiovascular disease. It’s like when astronauts return from space flights having lost most of their good bacteria because they had no access to real food. Well, too many of us are leading an “astronaut-type lifestyle,” not eating fresh fruits and vegetables. For example, the astronauts lost nearly 100% of their Lactobacillus plantarum, which is one of the good guys. But most Americans don’t have any to begin with, though those that eat more plant-based are certainly doing better. Use it or lose it. If you feed people resistant starch, a type of fiber found in beans, within days the bacteria that eat resistant starch shoot up, and then die back off when you stop eating it. Eating just a half can of chickpeas every day may modulate the intestinal microbial composition to promote intestinal health, by increasing potentially good bacteria and decreasing pathogenic and putrefactive bacteria. Unfortunately most Americans don’t eat beans every day, or whole grains, or enough fruits and vegetables, so the gut flora, the gut microbiota of a seemingly healthy person may not be the equivalent to a healthy gut flora. It’s possible that the Western microbiota is actually dysbiotic in the first place, just because we’re eating such fiber-deficient diets compared to populations that may eat five times more fiber and end up with like 50 times less colon cancer.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""Inadequate consumption of prebiotics—the fiber and resistant starch concentrated in unprocessed plant foods—can cause a disease promoting imbalance in our gut microbiome.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

The problem is that we’re eating these meat-sweet diets, characterized by a high intake of animal products, sugars, processed foods, and a low intake of whole plant foods. Contrary to the fermentation of the carbohydrates that make it down to our colon—the fiber and resistant starch that benefit us through the generation of these magical short chain fatty acids like butyrate—microbial protein fermentation, when excess protein is consumed… that generates potentially toxic and pro-carcinogenic metabolites involved in colorectal cancer. And so, what we eat can cause an imbalance in our gut microbiome and potentially create a ‘recipe’ for colorectal cancer, where a high-fat, high-meat, high processed food diet tips the scale towards dysbiosis and colorectal cancer, whereas a high-fiber and starch, lower meat diet can pull you back into symbiosis with your friendly flora and away from cancer. We now have evidence from interventional studies suggesting that “adopting a plant-based, minimally processed high-fiber diet may rapidly reverse the effects of meat-based diets on the gut microbiome.” So, what may be a new form of personalized microbiome medicine for chronic disease? It’s called food, which can rapidly and reproducibly alter the human gut microbiome. Switch people between a whole food plant-based diet and more of an animal food-based diet, and you can see dramatic shifts within two days, which can result in toxic metabolites. Switch people to an animal food-based diet and levels of deoxycholic acid go up, which is a secondary bile acid known to promote DNA damage and liver cancers. Why do levels go up? Because the bad bacteria producing the stuff triple—in just two days. And over time the richness of the microbial diversity in our gut is disappearing. Here’s our bacterial tree of life that’s getting depleted. Why is this happening? The fiber gap. “A low-fiber diet is a key driver of microbiome depletion.” Yeah, there’s antibiotics, and cesarean sections, and indoor plumbing, but the only factor that has been empirically demonstrated to be important is a diet low in MACs (not Big Macs), microbiota-accessible carbohydrates, which is just a fancy name for fiber found in a whole plant foods and resistant starch found mostly in beans, peas, lentils, and whole grains. Our intake of dietary fiber, our intake of whole plant foods, is negligibly low in the Western world when compared to what we evolved to eat over millions of years. Such a low-fiber diet provides insufficient nutrients for our gut microbes, leading not only to the loss of bacterial diversity and richness, but also to the reduction in the production of those beneficial fermentation end products that they make with the fiber. We are in effect, starving our microbial self. What are we going to do about the deleterious consequences of a diet deficient in whole plant foods? Create new-fangled functional foods, of course, and supplements, and drugs—prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics. Think how much money there is to be made! Or, we could just eat the way our bodies were meant to eat. What kind of value is that going to get your stockholders, though? Don’t you know probiotic pills may be the next big source of big pharma billions? Why eat healthy though, when you can just have someone else eat healthy for you and then get a fecal transplant from a vegan! Researchers compared the microbiomes of vegans versus omnivores, and found the vegan’s friendly flora were churning out more of the good stuff, showing that a plant-based diet may result in more beneficial metabolites in the bloodstream and less of the bad stuff like TMAO. But while the impact of a vegan diet on what the bacteria were making was large, the effect on the composition of the gut microbiome was surprisingly modest. They only found “slight differences between the gut microbiomes of omnivores versus vegans”? That was a shocker to the researchers; this very modest difference juxtaposed against the significantly enhanced dietary consumption of fermentable plant foods. The vegans were eating nearly twice the fiber. Anyone see the problem here? The vegans just barely made the minimum daily intake of fiber. Why? Because Oreos are vegan, Cocoa Pebbles are vegan, french fries, Coke, potato chips, there are vegan Doritos and Pop-Tarts. You can eat a terrible vegan diet. Burkitt showed that you need to get at least 50 grams a day (of fiber) for colon cancer prevention. That’s only half of what our bodies were designed to get. We evolved getting about 100 grams a day. And that’s what you see in modern populations that are immune to epidemic colorectal cancer. So, what if instead of feeding people a vegan diet, you just fed people that kind of diet, a diet centered around whole plant foods? We’ll find out next.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'What happens to our gut flora when we switch from a more animal-based diet to a more plant-based diet?\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Typical Western diets can decimate our good gut flora. We live with trillions of symbionts, good bacteria that live in symbiosis with us. We help them, they help us, and a month on a plant-based diet results in an increase of the good guys, and a decrease in the bad, the so-called pathobionts, the disease-causing bugs. “Given the disappearance of pathobionts from the intestine, one would expect to observe a  reduction in intestinal inflammation.” So, they measured stool concentrations of lipocalin-2, which is a sensitive biomarker of intestinal inflammation, and within a month of eating healthy, it had declined significantly, suggesting that promotion of microbial homeostasis, or balance, by a strict vegetarian diet resulted in reduced intestinal inflammation, and this rebalancing may have played a role in improved metabolic and immune system parameters. On an animal-based diet, you get growth of disease-associated species like bilophila wadsworthia, associated with inflammatory bowel disease, and A. putredinis, found in abscesses and appendicitis, and a decrease in fiber-eating bacteria. Eat fiber, and the fiber munching bacteria multiply, and we get more anti-inflammatory, anti-cancer short-chain fatty acids. Eat less fiber, and our fiber- eating bacteria starve away They are what we eat. Eat a lot of phytates, and your gut flora get really good at breaking down phytates. We assumed that this was just because we were naturally selecting for those populations of bacteria that could do that, but it turns out our diet can teach old bugs new tricks. There’s one type of fiber in nori seaweed that our gut bacteria can’t normally breakdown, but the bacteria out in the ocean that eat seaweed have the enzyme to do so. When it was discovered that the enzyme was present in the guts of Japanese people, it presented a mystery. Sure, sushi is eaten raw; and so, some seaweed bacteria may have made it into their colons, but how could some marine bacteria thrive in the human gut? It didn’t need to; it transferred the nori-eating enzyme to our own gut bacteria. “Consequently, the consumption of food with associated environmental bacteria is the most likely mechanism that [promoted the enzyme update into our own gut microbes],” almost like a software update. We have the same hardware, the same gut bacteria, but they just updated their software to chew on something new. Hardware can change too, though. The reason this  is called, “The way to a man’s heart is through his gut and microbiota” is because they were talking about TMAO. Certain gut flora can take carnitine from the red meat we eat, or the choline concentrated in dairy, seafood, and eggs and convert it into a toxic compound which may lead to an increase in our risk of heart attack, stroke, and death. This explains why those eating more plant based diets have lower blood concentrations of the stuff, but they also produce less of the toxin even if you feed them a steak. You don’t see the same conversion, suggesting an adaptive response of the gut microbiota in omnivores. They are what we feed them. It’s like if you give people cyclamate, a synthetic artificial sweetener, most of our bacteria don’t know what to do with it. But if you feed it to people for 10 days and select for the few bacteria that were hip to the new synthetic chemical, eventually three quarters of the cyclamate you eat is metabolized by the bacteria into another new compound called cyclohexylamine. But stop eating it and those bacteria die back. Unfortunately, cyclohexylamine may be toxic and so, was banned by the FDA in 1969, whereas, regular Kool-Aid, evidently, is completely safe. But, if you just ate cyclamate once in a while, it wouldn’t turn into cyclohexamine, because you wouldn’t have fed and fostered the gut flora specialized to do so, and the same with TMAO. Those that just eat red meat, or eggs, or seafood once in a while would presumably make very little of the toxin because they hadn’t been cultivating the bacteria that produce it.'), Document(metadata={'description': ""New subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Stick your hand out, thumbs up, feel for the knobby bone  at the top of your wrist. Then, if you slide your hand down  across the front of your wrist, you’ll feel these like  strands of spaghetti— those are the tendons in your wrist. If you lightly feel between the  knobby bone and that first tendon, you should feel your pulse. Got it? Okay, now we’re going  to feel what happens to our pulse when we take a deep breath. We’re going to try it twice. Try to feel what happens to  your pulse when you inhale, and when you exhale. All right, here we go— slow inhale… slow exhale. One more time… What happened when you  breathed in and breathed out? You should have felt your pulse  speed up when you breathe in and slow down when you breathe out -- that’s called heart rate variability, and it’s a very good thing. That’s a measure of the control  our nerves have over our heart. This is the survival curve for  people after a heart attack. With good heart rate variability, 9 out of 10 people are  still alive four years later. But with bad heart rate variability,  in that time period, half drop dead from sudden cardiac death. Is there anything we can do to improve our neurological  control over our heart? A landmark article this year in the  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition found that there was  only one type of food that could significantly improve  our heart rate variability. Is it citrus fruits, omega-3s, or dark green leafy vegetables? Let’s look at the graph. Here’s the level at which  statistical significance is reached. Let’s see which one makes it. Eating just a half serving  of greens every day significantly improved  neuronal heart control— which may be why studies in the past have suggested a quarter  cup of greens a day could cut our risk of having  a heart attack by 67%!

The reason lignans is in quotes is because flax doesn’t actually contain any lignans — just like broccoli doesn’t actually contain sulforaphane. Flax does contain lignan precursors, though, which the good bacteria in our gut turn into lignans, which we can then absorb. So, lignans are more of a team effort. We used to think our colon was just some transit tube that absorbed excess water. Now we know it houses what could be considered an entirely separate organ inside the body: our gut flora, our trillions of good bacteria; the densest concentration of microbes found anywhere on Earth. Exceeding the metabolic capacity of our liver by a factor of a hundred, our good bacteria detoxify some compounds, and activate others, boosting their bioavailability. In fact, that may be why urinary tract infections have been associated with breast cancer risk. The rounds of antibiotics may be wiping out some of the good bacteria that are helping us take advantage of all the wonders of a plant-based diet. I think most people only tend to think of our gut bacteria when there’s a problem.

Fiber continues to  be singled out as a nutrient of  public health concern. There is a fiber  gap in America. These are the minimum recommended  daily intakes of fiber for men and women at  different age groups; this is how much we’re  actually getting. We’re only getting about  half the minimum, considered a public health  concern for all Americans. Well, not ALL  Americans. Less than 3% meet the  recommended minimum, meaning less than  3% of all Americans eat enough  plant-based foods, the only place  fiber is found, though a nominal 0.1 is thrown in for the meat category in case someone eats a corn dog  or nibbles on the garnish. If even half of the adult population  ate 3 more grams a day, like a quarter cup of beans  or a bowl of oatmeal, we could save billions  in medical costs, and that’s just  for constipation. The consumption  of plant foods, the consumption of  fiber-containing foods reduce risk for diabetes,  heart disease, stroke, cancer, and  obesity as well. The first to make this link between  fiber intake and killer disease was probably Dr. Hugh Trowell  many decades ago. He spent 30 years  practicing in Africa and suspected it was their high  consumption of corn, millet, sweet potatoes,  greens, and beans that protected them  from chronic disease. This kind of got twisted into  the so-called fiber hypothesis, but he didn’t think it  was the fiber itself, but the high-fiber foods  that were so protective. There are hundreds of different  things in whole grains besides fiber that may  have beneficial effects. For example, yes the fiber  in oatmeal can lower our blood cholesterol levels so  less gets stuck in our arteries, but there are anti-inflammatory,  and antioxidant phytonutrients in oats that can help prevent  atherosclerotic build-up and then help maintain  arterial function. Visionaries like Trowell  were not entrapped by the reductionist “simple-minded”  focus on dietary fiber and insisted that the whole plant  foods should receive the emphasis. Fiber intake was just kind of a  marker for plant food intake. Those with highest fiber intake,  and the lowest cholesterol, were those who ate  exclusively plant-based diets. Risk factors like cholesterol  are one thing, but can these individual foods actually  affect the progression of heart disease? We didn’t know, until this  study was published. Hundreds of older women were subjected  to coronary angiograms, where you can inject dye into  the coronary arteries of the heart to see how wide  open they are. They got an angiogram at  the beginning of the study, and then one a  few years later, all while analyzing  their diets. This is what  they found. The arteries of women  eating less than a serving of whole grains a day  significantly narrowed, whereas the arteries of women  who ate just a single serving or more also  significantly narrowed, but they  narrowed less. These were all women  with heart disease eating the standard  American diet, and so their arteries were  progressively clogging shut— heart disease is the #1 killer  of American women, but there was significantly  LESS clogging in the women eating  more whole grains, significantly less progression  of their atherosclerosis. In fact, almost as much slowing of  their disease as one might get taking cholesterol  lowering statin drugs. Statins can also slow the rate  at which our arteries close. But do we want to just slow the rate  at which we die from heart disease, or NOT die from heart  disease at all? A whole food, plant-based diet has been shown to REVERSE the progression  of heart disease, opening our arteries  back up. Whole grains, like the drug,  can help counter the artery-clogging effects  of the rest of the diet. Having oatmeal with bacon and eggs, is better than just eating  bacon and eggs, but better,perhaps, to stop eating  an artery-clogging diet altogether.'), Document(metadata={'description': 'Less than 3% of Americans meet the daily recommended fiber intake, despite research suggesting high-fiber foods such as whole grains can affect the progression of coronary heart disease.\n\nNew subscribers to our e-newsletter always receive a free gift.

Here are some key foods that benefit both these aspects of health:

1. **Whole Grains**: Foods like oatmeal, barley, and whole wheat help reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering cholesterol levels and improving blood sugar control. They also provide essential nutrients and fiber that support gut health by promoting the growth of beneficial bacteria.

2. **Legumes**: Beans, lentils, chickpeas, and peas are high in fiber and plant-based protein. They can improve heart health by helping to lower cholesterol levels and blood pressure. For gut health, the fiber in legumes helps prevent constipation and promotes a healthy microbiome.

3. **Nuts and Seeds**: These are good sources of fiber, healthy fats, and protein. Nuts like almonds, walnuts, and seeds such as flaxseeds and chia seeds can help reduce inflammation and are linked to a lower risk of heart disease. They also contribute to gut health by providing fiber that feeds beneficial gut bacteria.

4. **Fruits and Vegetables**: Rich in fiber, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants, fruits and vegetables like berries, apples, leafy greens, and cruciferous vegetables (like broccoli and Brussels sprouts) support heart health by lowering blood pressure and reducing inflammation. They also enhance gut health through their fiber content and variety of nutrients that promote a diverse microbiome.

5. **Fermented Foods**: Foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi contain probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that can help balance the gut microbiome. A healthy gut flora is linked to reduced inflammation and may lower the risk of heart disease.

5. **Fermented Foods**: Foods like yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, and kimchi contain probiotics, which are beneficial bacteria that can help balance the gut microbiome. A healthy gut flora is linked to reduced inflammation and may lower the risk of heart disease.

Incorporating these foods into a balanced diet can contribute significantly to both heart and gut health, promoting overall well-being.
